[00:00:00] Unknown: It is. 

[00:00:02] Reed: We're natural. The rats and the mice and the birds and everything. It's like doing a certain crazy thing. 

[00:00:08] Sarah: And the weather, the way, yeah. Trash. It all just sort of Yes. 

[00:00:12] Anahita: Uh 

[00:00:13] Kim: oh. 

[00:00:14] Anahita: Yes, Kim! Roger.

It's 

[00:00:22] Unknown: a city nature. It's a city nature. It's a 

[00:00:25] Reed: city nature. City nature. City 

[00:00:29] Mia: nature.

How's your sleep been, Nia? Oh. Well, I don't know if I should do this. So I did a, I did like a free trial for this thing to track my sleep. I was gonna return it. And I got the email a couple days ago that my free trial ended and I've paid 240 for my membership now. Oh no! How long's it last? A year. But the thing is, like, I already got the data I needed.

And it wasn't that illuminating. I just don't sleep that much. I probably sleep not that good. How much do 

[00:01:11] Unknown: you sleep? 

[00:01:12] Mia: Well, according to this, my average, these days has been five and a half. That's it? 

[00:01:18] Reed: I need like nine hours a night. Yeah, I don't know. But do you lay down for more hours, or is it just like Um, no.

So you only sleep, you like, go to bed? 

[00:01:29] Mia: Well, sometimes I lay down. How does the watch know? It's like your heart rate, your resting heart rate, I think. What's actually really cool, not that this is new, Like, this is cool to look at, but I don't really know how this would inform my habits. It's like, you see how much of your sleep is like, light sleep, deep sleep, REM, awake.

So I do see, like, after I drink, I have like, Really little REM, even though I fall asleep really quickly. Which is what the doctors say. But, yeah, you don't 

[00:01:58] Sarah: like, you don't want to believe them. I know, I'm always like, oh, I sleep 

[00:02:01] Mia: so great after drinking. But, uh, I see now that I 

[00:02:07] Sarah: don't. Yeah. Interesting. 

[00:02:08] Mia: And it's kind 

[00:02:09] Reed: of 

[00:02:09] Mia: fun, because it shows you your graphs.

It shows you, like, when, you know, when, when you go to sleep, like when you wake up. Like, little bar graphs. 

[00:02:19] Unknown: I 

[00:02:19] Mia: always sleep really bad when Kim is not there because then I just play in my room by myself. Oh my god. You're so good for Mia. I know. No, but I, it, there's actually such a correlation when you're there.

I sleep so much earlier. Yeah. 

[00:02:36] Unknown: I play in my room. 

[00:02:38] Reed: Kim, do you have quite, do you like go to bed, you like to like go to bed or something when it's bedtime? I, 

[00:02:44] Kim: Mia just has crazy levels of energy and Mia frankly doesn't need sleep. 

[00:02:48] Reed: So 

[00:02:51] Kim: interesting. That's so 

[00:03:01] Mia: funny. Which sometimes I do go on. But sometimes I'm like, oh, Tim is going to sleep.

I should go to sleep. Gonna lie down now. Do you fall asleep quickly? No, I never fall asleep quickly. Yeah, it always takes me a long 

[00:03:15] Kim: time.

Yeah. So interesting. Yeah, 

[00:03:25] Mia: it's really rare for me to fall asleep first. 

[00:03:30] Reed: Do you wake up early, intentionally, or just

[00:03:35] Mia: No, I don't really wake up that early. But once I wake up, I have a hard time going back to sleep. I'm the same. I'm the same. 

[00:03:41] Anahita: Do you drink anything to go to sleep? No, I got, I got, 

[00:03:47] Mia: I got lunch. Prescribed medication. Did 

[00:03:51] Sarah: you suggest milk? Milk! A glass of 

[00:03:54] Mia: milk. Mia's like, I know. Pee pee milk. Milk and honey. You don't have to be like, outside.

Melatonin. I'm 

[00:04:03] Unknown: like, no! Milk. Maybe we should just drive 

[00:04:07] Mia: milk. 

[00:04:07] Unknown: A glass of milk. Good old 

[00:04:11] Mia: fashioned way. 

[00:04:12] Kim: It's a warm milk. 

[00:04:14] Mia: Oh, I've tried it all. Well, this is why I, the best thing that helped me was alcohol. Until there was a period where I would just have a little glass of wine before I went to bed. But now I've seen that, like, it's, oh, like sleep.

It's not real sleep. Yeah, 

[00:04:29] Anahita: yeah. Do you do the magnesium thing? 

[00:04:31] Mia: Oh, that's, that, that's the best thing. That's the thing that everyone says. That's what I do every night. That has been the most helpful thing. Oh, that's amazing. That's really good. Highly recommend it. Magnesium glycinate. I take twice the recommended dosage.

But that actually really helps. I, 

[00:04:45] Reed: um, used to be really bad at sleep as well. And, um, well, I'm not saying you're bad, but Oh, it's okay, I'm bad. I'm bad at sleep. I found out about this, it's really cheesy, but it's this guy called the sleep doctor. It's so cheesy, but you do, like, a test and it tells you, like, what animal you are.

Oh my gosh. There's, like, four different animals, and it's, like, you have these different kind of, like, sleep patterns. Yeah. And most of us are bears. Yeah. And I am a bear. And then he, like, tells you what a bear should do, but he talks about, like, your sleep cycle, or, like, preparing to go to bed as soon as you wake up at the start of your day.

[00:05:20] Mia: Yeah. So he, 

[00:05:21] Reed: like, basically is, like, yeah, it's, like, your sleep routine to go to sleep starts with a bear. Wake up. Yeah, I heard that too. And then you have to like do all these things and now I like, I started like doing a lots of things and now I feel like way more like I can go to bed. Yeah. I bed running health bed.

When you were running, he's like, you shouldn't drink caffeine after 12, noon. 

[00:05:43] Mia: Oh no. Caffeine after 12? No. Oh, not after. Yeah. I actually, I don't, and the thing is like, I'm really good about all that stuff. And it definitely does help, because when I don't follow it, it makes it so much worse. But, I don't know, sometimes I'm just like, it's not fair that I have to put so much effort in.

Yeah. Well, like, I have to, yeah, like no caffeine, like no naps, like I wake up early. But, I don't know, I think I also have just, I think some people do need more sleep, and some people actually don't need that much sleep. And my mom also, she sleeps less than me. Like, she sleeps so little. And if I sleep early, then I wake up in the middle of the night.

And like, and sometimes, if I, if I sleep very, very, very little, then I'll have like a normal night of sleep. But if I sleep one night of normal sleep, I'm like, by normal, I'm in like eight hours. There's no way I can sleep eight hours the next day. So I think that's also like a sign that I'm just not meant, like my body just doesn't work that way.

And I function. Like, I don't notice a significant decrease in my function until, like, less than five hours I do. But, I don't know, yeah, I think, like, something I've also just, like, learned in therapy and psychiatry is, like, not pushing it. Because, if I'm not tired and I try to feel better And I try to fall asleep.

It's the worst. It is miserable, like just lying there for like hours. 

[00:07:13] Reed: They say that you should never be laying in bed if you're awake, that you should get up, read a book, or do something. And we're just like, that's not what it is. As soon as you wake up in the morning as well you should get up. Yeah. Then you associate your bed with like being awake and stressed.

Totally, yeah exactly. And it's meant to just be Yeah, also, yeah, loads of weird things, like only using your bed for sleeping. Yeah, which I do, also. I will 

[00:07:38] Mia: say the one thing I'm not great about is I use screens before bed. But, it's hard. What am I supposed to do? Too many things, too many things, so many things.

Like two hours before bed? Yeah. But they have 

[00:07:52] Reed: done like, more research in terms of like, because I think like, humans would have slept in cycles. Yeah. So there's some people, Like sleep less because I don't know I can't remember if I read this, if I read this, it's like, it's a 

[00:08:08] Mia: delayed sleep wake cycle Where like I think I have this where my body just doesn't get tired until much later, but I also Oftentimes wake up later and sometimes our circadian rhythm like some is just set to later.

Yeah, and that's 

[00:08:23] Reed: because it's more of a minority group, but it would have been really useful. Like, it's like a ballet. Welcome to ballet for me! There's some people who have like, later rhythms, because you would like, Stay up late, and then you would go to sleep, and other people would wake up early, so it's like everything is done in shift.

So it was very like normal, it was like normalised and that's just, but now we don't really have use for that. So it feels like, because the majority clock is operating on this other time, and it's like, Oh, that's like this abnormal thing that you need to like fix that. Except 

[00:08:55] Sarah: we actually do have a use for it, and it's called doctor, right?

True. Not the kind of doctor you're going 

[00:09:01] Mia: to be. I was going to say. I was going to say, it actually is great now that I'm working from home, so I'm not really working, because I can just go to bed late and like, wake up late. But when I was on my surgery rotation, like, I can't be going to bed at 4 and then waking up at 5.

Like, that was, during my surgery rotation, I like, slept so little, 

[00:09:23] Reed: because It's like you just have to wake up early. My friend Alistair is one of my best friends in the UK, he's the same, he's like, he's like so smart. Apparently he's also, you have a really high, people who are like that have high IQs. He was a red man somewhere, I don't know why I know he was a red man.

Yeah, no, did 

[00:09:39] Mia: you know Einstein? Almost slept like four hours. And they're like, they investigate, like there's something genetic, like there's a genetic aspect to it. I also 

[00:09:45] Sarah: feel like it's something that your brain is like, worrying and like, excited about the world. You know, and so it doesn't want to sleep.

Like there's a sort of like, mental stimulus going on. Oh, if I'm excited, 

[00:09:54] Mia: I am definitely not sleeping.

[00:10:00] Kim: Yeah, exactly. You're done for. 

[00:10:05] Mia: No, but, yeah. It's funny because I feel like people who sleep a lot are like, Oh, I wish I could stay up more, I could do so many things. But the thing is, I just get tired of being awake. Sometimes I don't feel like doing anything. I just want to be 

[00:10:20] Sarah: asleep. Yeah, that's a really good point.

And it's a good lesson for, uh, for dying, too, I think. It's like, guys, you're gonna get tired, you're gonna get 

[00:10:33] Mia: tired. It's interesting because I'm, uh, I'm doing this course now to be trained as a CBT therapist, and I recently did, like, my CBT for insomnia session, whatever. So, And something they were saying is to lie in bed and be like, I'm gonna stay awake, I'm gonna stay awake, I'm gonna stay awake.

And oftentimes, like, when you're trying to do the opposite thing, you do the other thing. Yeah. So I feel like oftentimes when I'm in bed, I'm like, Relax. Relax. Stop thinking. Stop thinking! No, it's too stressful. Like, I'm literally 

[00:11:07] Reed: like, 

[00:11:07] Mia: Relax, Mia. 

[00:11:08] Reed: Relax. 

[00:11:09] Mia: Relax. Sometimes I do 

[00:11:11] Reed: that as well. But no, the opposite one.

I tried it in the morning. I'm like, okay, read if you're awake and I'm gone. Get out of bed! Go and get out of bed. I know it's like getting really cold and stuff, and it's really hot. But you want to get out of bed? 

[00:11:23] Mia: You can't. You can't. And when I'm like, oh, I didn't get enough sleep, I really need to go back to sleep.

I'm wide awake. Here we go.

Thoroughbred psychology. 

[00:11:37] Sarah: It's like, your head is like your, like the mom, or like that boy said, he's like your mom, and then your body's like the child. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I don't want to. I don't want to. Whatever you say, I 

[00:11:47] Kim: don't 

[00:11:50] Mia: My 

[00:11:52] Anahita: aunt also sleeps very little, and she always used to say this, that like, Yeah, when I die, I'll sleep.

I don't want to sleep. I 

[00:12:02] Mia: don't want to sleep. Obsessed with that energy. I think the only times when I really want to sleep are when I know I have to wake up early the next day, and I'm like, I actually need to get some sleep in. But if I have nothing the next day, that's like these days, when I have nothing, I'm like The other night when Kim wasn't there, 4.

30! 4. 30! 

[00:12:25] Reed: That's funny. Kate's like that as well. And she doesn't run on much. And she also only goes to bed because I go to bed at like, 11 or something. 

[00:12:35] Mia: Yeah. It's hard. Cause especially if I'm doing things and I'm like, well Why would I go to bed if I don't feel like it? 

[00:12:42] Sarah: It's kind of nice if you have a partner though because then it's like if you're living with your partner it's like your time alone in this space.

Yeah, yeah, That's what I like about it because it's like there's some things like I want to do but like I just want to be alone. Yeah. And like you can do that in an hour. Oh my gosh, yeah, we've 

[00:12:55] Mia: talked about this. That's nice. And it's 

[00:12:58] Reed: alone time. Late at night. Yeah. 

[00:13:03] Anahita: I think my habit has been like so different like throughout like months and years.

May and like until like the end of the summer, I was sleeping soon and waking up really soon. And then, but before May, I was like sleeping late and waking up soon. So I'm eating like six hours of sleep. And then, like when I went to residency, I was staying up late, waking up late. And then, now that I'm here, like, I go to bed just because I'm tired, like, for example, at 12, and I'm like, I'm gonna get up and, like, do this thing and then come back to sleep, and exactly, like, I just fall asleep, you know, and then, like, I wake up just, like, 

[00:13:51] Unknown: So today, 

[00:13:53] Anahita: like, last night I wanted to, like, get up and, like, pack some things because I was meeting this person at 10.

And I was like, okay, I'm gonna do it, but I was looking at my screen, which is supposed to keep you awake Yeah, and then I was just dead And then I woke up at 8. 30, like, thinking that, like, I have missed that meeting. That's the worst thing that could happen. I was like, wow. So you just fell asleep. Yeah. 

[00:14:20] Reed: I fell asleep.

That's so, I always wonder, like, that to me is so far away from that. I know. I would accidentally fall asleep, ever. Same. Except sometimes in the middle of the day when I'm 

[00:14:31] Mia: like, I'm like, I really need to study. Like, I'm really trying to study. I'm like, I can't take a nap. Then I fall asleep. Yeah. Yeah.

Interesting. But it's rare. It's pretty rare. Yeah. It's so weird. I think also there's like, like being in New York, I just wake up so early because it's so loud outside my window. Yeah, it's so 

[00:14:54] Sarah: loud. But I can't sleep in the country. Very well either. Really it's, I need at home, I sleep, so, oh, I'm so bad. Like I need like a white noise because I think my brain like it needs something to latch onto or else it'll just keep like, worrying, worrying, worrying, worrying.

But if there's like a little noise and it's like it can like focus on that. Yeah. Yeah. 

[00:15:12] Reed: Interesting. Yeah. My roommate Greg, I want like pure, like silence. Oh really? I would say literally like silent, silent silence. And I want it to be really cold. Yeah, yeah. Wait, I actually 

[00:15:25] Mia: have, I've hacked the system now, which is that when I need to wake up early.

So, I also like sleeping with it really cold, but it's so hard to get up in the morning. So, I now have this radiator that I have a remote. So, I wake up in the morning, I take my Adderall, I turn on my heater and then I go back to bed. And then like an hour later, my Adderall kicks in, it's warm in my room, I'm ready to get up.

[00:15:53] Unknown: Wait, so how 

[00:15:54] Reed: long for my Adderall? Because Adderall also is so hard to sleep after. Yes, no, I think that, like, that's 

[00:15:59] Mia: a huge, if I don't take my Adderall, I have no problem sleeping. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I have no problem sleeping. But that's, like, I have to take my Adderall, so. You really feel like you have to? Um, if I want to be, if I want to get anything done, yeah.

That's so 

[00:16:12] Unknown: interesting. 

[00:16:13] Mia: Yeah. If I don't take it, I mean, I am just so used to taking it now that sometimes I don't take it, but I feel really tired all day. Like, I feel really low energy. Like, I'm not very fun to talk to. 

[00:16:27] Reed: How long have you been taking it for? 

[00:16:31] Mia: A few years, 

[00:16:33] Reed: but I take it most days. Yeah. Yeah. I tried it in COVID and I was like, You're controlling me.

That's how I felt. I felt like really controlled. I was like, maybe, this is like, not to anyone, this is just me to myself, I'm like, maybe I want a nap in the day. Maybe I want to be tired. Like, I felt like it gave me this like, routine. Yeah. Like a top down routine onto me, and I was like, so, like, annoyed.

Yeah. I was like, I don't want to be awake right now! Like, I was 

[00:17:00] Sarah: like, Maybe I don't want to do anything. If I don't want to go to 

[00:17:04] Reed: sleep, like, let me be tired. And lazy 

[00:17:07] Sarah: and productive. And just like, yeah. If I want 

[00:17:11] Mia: to be lazy and productive, I do that. But I needed a little bit, because I was really, before I was on it, I was really unhinged.
