[00:00:00] Harry: Yeah, regardless, there's a there's a lot of people use it to commute. It's a very busy bus. There's 15, 000 people who take it every day. Um, and so It's one of the, during rush hour, it's one of the sort of top offenders of a lot of people riding it, and it's going slow. And the buses are small. 
[00:00:36] Jackie: And the buses are standard.
Same thing. 
[00:00:40] Harry: They have long buses. They have long buses. Maybe they should have one too. A bus lane. So, the city's response is, there's a lot of people riding it, and the bus takes a long time. Hello, how are you? Hey, how 
[00:00:55] Music: are you? 
[00:00:55] Harry: Howdy. 
[00:00:56] Music: Should I put a 
[00:00:56] Waiter: drink or some wine 
[00:00:57] Music: or anything? 
[00:00:58] Waiter: Uh, who wants wine? Maybe we'll order a bottle.
I'd have wine. Yeah, I'd have wine. Wine's fine. Uh, one red, white. Any preference? Red or 
[00:01:09] Matt: white? I 
[00:01:09] Jackie: like 
[00:01:09] Matt: both. 
[00:01:10] Jackie: I do. Yeah. I don't care. I'm leaning towards red, but you guys don't. Let's do red. Yeah, I 
[00:01:16] Sarah: agree. 
[00:01:17] Jackie: Yeah, yeah, it's 
[00:01:18] Sarah: hard. Well, you need one person who is. Cause then they can, like, have an opinion. I want someone to 
[00:01:25] Matt: have an opinion.
Uh, so we're on red. Uh, with body. A little dry, not too dry. Uh, 
[00:01:34] Sarah: yeah. I like this. 
[00:01:38] Matt: Did you get the shirt? 
[00:01:40] Sarah: What? 
[00:01:40] Matt: Where's the shirt from? 
[00:01:41] Sarah: Um, college. These are all things you say to someone. I thought about her. 
[00:01:45] Matt: These are like the terms of art. 
[00:01:48] Sarah: The thing about wine though is if you get good at it, then you're going to be in a situation where you're dissatisfied by the wine.
There's nothing worse than being good at wine. 
[00:01:56] Matt: Yeah. 
[00:01:57] Sarah: Like, it's sort of a, it's fun 
[00:02:00] Matt: momentarily. 
[00:02:03] Harry: I enjoy wine now. I 
[00:02:04] Matt: don't know why I think about it. 
[00:02:06] Harry: Yeah, you have Cabernet and wine. Yeah. I'm not going to enjoy it anymore if I know more about it. 
[00:02:09] Matt: Bordeaux is blend. It's not only Cuban, it's blend. 
[00:02:12] Harry: Oh!
Interesting. I think I 
[00:02:14] Matt: have to 
[00:02:14] Music: find 
[00:02:15] Matt: something. You can find 
[00:02:16] Harry: the Iran 
[00:02:17] Matt: one. Albatross. That's it? You 
[00:02:18] Harry: can 
[00:02:18] Matt: go to Rome, Bordeaux, and then American one. Okay, thank you. Take your time. I think, I think Bordeaux. You gotta go Bordeaux, 
[00:02:25] Jackie: man. Yeah, Bordeaux. Or 
[00:02:26] Matt: Marseille. 
[00:02:27] Jackie: That sounds good. 
[00:02:28] Harry: I would know. 
[00:02:30] Jackie: You kind of know. 
[00:02:31] Harry: I don't know anything.
I, I resist. 
[00:02:36] Jackie: What I've done is, I order from the same place on Broadway. And when I, there was a white wine that Matt and I like, and a red wine. And they have it on my, uh, on the computer. And I just call and 
[00:02:54] Harry: say, 
[00:02:54] Jackie: give me two of this and two of that. And they deliver it. 
[00:03:00] Sarah: Yeah. That is nice. Easy. Yeah. I do, I kind of like the hunt of it though.
Ha! So I, I go in and I go to one store. You want to be influenced. I want to, well no, I want to pick the winner. You know. Yeah. And so I, I often don't. But, it there, it's a fun challenge. You know. 
[00:03:18] Jackie: I didn't 
[00:03:19] Sarah: even know that 
[00:03:21] Jackie: we were all going to do this today. I thought we would do it tomorrow. And Matt called me.
I had just come back with Suzie. And she was like. Making some broccoli for me because I don't eat enough broccoli. And Matt called and I'm like, wait, isn't this good? But I'm happy, so happy to be here on a Saturday or a Friday. 
[00:03:47] Sarah: Any day. 
[00:03:48] Harry: What is, uh, I have not, I forgot to listen to who we're seeing. What is the, what's the vibe?
It's an organ? What? Piano player. It's a piano trio, so it's going to be like the most classic, kind of, very tight sound. 
[00:04:02] Jackie: I see live music, or hear live music, so rarely. Piano trio. It's my favorite play with Art Blakey. I mean, I would ever do that. So he comes from 
[00:04:10] Matt: that, so straight ahead, hard boxed vision.
Yeah, I just, sometimes whistle more 
[00:04:13] Jackie: with Matt and my cousin Laura. He's sort of not, he's like that middle generation. He's the guy, he's like in his 40s. All of a sudden, they're in. Yeah. 
[00:04:24] Matt: It's uh, It's very good. And I really like Verlandt. Have you been to Verlandt? 
[00:04:32] Sarah: I've been to Verlandt. Yes. It was quite nice.
Harry learned to sail. 
[00:04:38] Waiter: Oh my god. 
[00:04:41] Sarah: Oh, is Harry sailing? 
[00:04:43] Jackie: Well, you do. 
[00:04:44] Sarah: Well, I kind of, I'm not, I'm not very good. I, I get scared to be honest, but it's, it's in my culture, so I want, I would like Harry to know . 
[00:04:54] Jackie: Well, Harry's uncle has a small yacht, so Oh yeah. That family though. It's true. There's no, 
[00:05:00] Sarah: that's motor.
That's, but that doesn't count. I think that's, it's, and it's much. Well, that's graceful. It's an uglier, you know, sailboats are so pretty. You put a white little triangle on the sea and it's like, it's gorgeous. Yeah. Yeah. 
[00:05:15] Harry: Alright, I got it. We're gonna get a Bordeaux from 
[00:05:18] Matt: Marco. 
[00:05:18] Sarah: Okay. 
[00:05:19] Matt: And it's gonna be Chateau Latour du Mont 2014.
[00:05:23] Sarah: Yeah. I like your order map. I think that's what I would ask for if I like knew what I your Yeah, like a little dry, medium, you know. 
[00:05:35] Matt: This is medium. A little bit of some fruit. Dried, some spice. Yes, can we get a bottle of the Chateau La Tour Du Monde? Five, six, 
[00:05:52] Jackie: zero. 
[00:05:53] Matt: Yep. 
[00:05:54] Jackie: Yeah. That boat 
[00:05:56] Music: is 
[00:05:57] Jackie: sweet. Looks like 
[00:05:58] Music: a great 
[00:05:59] Waiter: boat to learn on.
[00:06:00] Sarah: So that's your family 
[00:06:01] Waiter: boat. 
[00:06:02] Sarah: No, we have a, um, let me show you, our family boat. You're welcome. Is like, much bigger. This, this is my um, Like my, my mom has a little sunfish. It's tiny, but we grew up on like big, Let me show you what, The middle, the baseboard in the middle. Yes, you can set up by 
[00:06:19] Harry: yourself. Yeah, bigger boats, that's better.
Yeah, yeah, I mean yeah. One of my responsibilities was to periodically check it out because, uh, The show that, uh, I guess, uh, Never had, never came close to never to do that, But, uh, yeah. Seaweed kelp on, it'll slow us down. Yep. That was a problem I love. That's great. And you could like feel Yeah, it's not that big of a sail.
So like when, when we would just start to go slower, it would be like, like the ratio of the keel to the sail. I think that 
[00:06:51] Jackie: learned how to sail actually with his law 
[00:06:54] Matt: learned.
[00:06:58] Sarah: Yeah. I think Matt does know. Just, 
[00:07:00] Matt: yeah. Engineer. 
[00:07:02] Jackie: Engineer. Yeah. 
[00:07:03] Sarah: Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Um, this is, this is the one that my grandpa, yeah. It's very pretty. It's very, yeah. Like a lot of like, the wooden, yeah. He likes the wooden. And 
[00:07:17] Jackie: do they manage to work on it a little bit more? 
[00:07:19] Sarah: Well, they do. That's, that's the problem now.
It's starting to happen. I still don't totally understand 
[00:07:23] Harry: how it works. 
[00:07:24] Jackie: Yeah, they have similar roles. They both pass. And now it's like the family's like, can we pull it up? Can we wear it? My grandparents. 
[00:07:33] Harry: No, just like, an airfoil, 
[00:07:35] Jackie: is 
[00:07:36] Harry: it sail? Or a wing? Not a plane? 
[00:07:39] Jackie: Uh, I 
[00:07:40] Harry: don't understand. People just say like, that's one part of a job.
It doesn't like, make sense to me. No, same, yeah. But, If you internalize the behavior enough times, and you can see like, when it looks like that, this happens, and it looks like that, this other 
[00:07:52] Music: thing happens. That's 
[00:07:53] Harry: the hard thing. The hard thing for you 
[00:07:56] Matt: is, the fast that you go is not what's behind you. The fast that you go is what's in front of 
[00:08:01] Harry: you, and you're joking about 
[00:08:04] Jackie: it.
But then once 
[00:08:05] Matt: you, like, 
[00:08:07] Harry: you do see, 
[00:08:08] Matt: because it's so physical, so you're not actually seeing it, but you're literally, 
[00:08:11] Jackie: Oh, where about? Where was it? Oh, the Catskill, okay. That was, yeah, that was our adventure in water. 
[00:08:21] Matt: Um, 
[00:08:22] Jackie: you can literally run and see the 
[00:08:25] Matt: bottom of the ocean. I like, and I love looking at the ocean and the high 
[00:08:31] Jackie: water.
But my ocean 
[00:08:33] Matt: is strong, you know? But 
[00:08:35] Jackie: my husband 
[00:08:36] Matt: and I 
[00:08:37] Jackie: never went swimming in the summer. Never 
[00:08:40] Matt: had any 
[00:08:41] Jackie: of 
[00:08:42] Matt: the events. Yeah, 
[00:08:43] Jackie: very strong. Yeah. I have two ashes up in my bedroom. I think we're all going to go to Manny's. Oh my god, yeah, yeah. They won't, the city doesn't allow you 
[00:08:56] Waiter: to see the parks. Oh, they, um, they're 
[00:09:01] Jackie: considering, they're 
[00:09:02] Waiter: thinking of something, 
[00:09:04] Jackie: chemicals, grass, I mean, oh my god.
There's enough chemicals in that grass. 
[00:09:10] Harry: So I think we 
[00:09:12] Jackie: should do that. So we'll go out. 
[00:09:15] Harry: It makes it go faster to be flat. But there were definitely some moments where, uh, But it was mostly just 
[00:09:22] Sarah: like, Yeah, I guess 
[00:09:24] Harry: so. Do you 
[00:09:24] Sarah: want them in the ocean, or do you have a preference? The ocean. 
[00:09:28] Jackie: Oh, you know, I mean, But it's not that wonderful.
It's 
[00:09:32] Harry: probably 
[00:09:32] Jackie: a different person. Also, I 
[00:09:36] Harry: mean, 
[00:09:37] Jackie: Yeah, I guess it'd probably be different. It's pretty lazy, I'll say. Yeah, where we were but also like I'm 
[00:09:45] Harry: so bad. Oh my god
Everything flips. Yeah, like your intuition kind of goes away Yeah, it was actually pretty hard for me Physically actually, right? Yeah. Would you 
[00:09:59] Matt: guys maybe like order the food while we ran for the wine? Sure. I think Well, does everyone know what they does? Everyone ready? Do we a couple minutes? Maybe another minute?
Okay. Okay. Thank you. Here's what I think you're gonna like. I think you would love the, I don't want 
[00:10:15] Jackie: the bg. 
[00:10:17] Music: What the other, what were the other picture? Stick free. 
[00:10:21] Sarah: Stay 
[00:10:23] Music: free. Stay free. 
[00:10:26] Sarah: Harry, are you in the mood to split some? Two things? And 
[00:10:29] Matt: then I would Like Start, I would 
[00:10:32] Harry: When you started 
[00:10:33] Sarah: Not me, you guys.
I was 
[00:10:34] Harry: gonna get the short ribs. Ooh. 
[00:10:37] Sarah: Oh. Short 
[00:10:38] Harry: ribs. 
[00:10:39] Sarah: No, you should just get that. I should eat steak. You're getting steak? No, I want to eat steak. Oh, is it iron? Do you eat iron? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, no, I've also been low on iron in my life. Really? Yeah. Yes. And, me, Nick. Yes. Yeah. I know. I get a little candor sores when I get it.
So, actually, I need to Is 
[00:11:02] Jackie: that why I get these things from NaNoWriMo? Maybe. 
[00:11:06] Sarah: Yeah. Like, I know I get, like, cuts in the corner of my mouth. Yeah. Happens. Yeah. Did you take a vitamin? Yep. Well, 
[00:11:14] Jackie: before there was such a, a low, uh, what is it called? Yeah. Test, right? Yeah. He just said, he just said change your diet.
Okay. I think that's good of him. Yeah, me too. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Put you on something new. He knows I don't want him to call me. Yeah. Where did 
[00:11:30] Harry: you fall? I was going to say, I thought, where do I fall? Usually, you know, across the street. 
[00:11:35] Matt: Um, where do I come on the bus lane? I gotta say, I am now twixt in between.
[00:11:42] Harry: Cause I, I What, can you Can we, can we, can we leave the dichotomy? And if, just like, in your ideal world, what would that street look like?
No cars, but that's, like, 
[00:11:57] Music: out of 
[00:11:57] Harry: a 
[00:11:57] Music: trend. But, no cars. Well, 
[00:11:58] Jackie: but just buses. 
[00:12:01] Music: No cars and 
[00:12:02] Matt: buses, but no parking. There are not that many streets. So I'm not sure, you know, it would be that big a loss. And I don't, I don't have a car, I don't really have a lot of stuff to give people real cars. Look at them, they're real though, they're maybe less.
They're maybe, I like them a little better than you can put them in a garage, because they have a little less money maybe, but not really. Just generally, you don't have a 
[00:12:23] Waiter: car. If you 
[00:12:24] Matt: have 
[00:12:25] Waiter: a car, you gotta pay for it. Oh, here we go. Good evening. Good evening. Chateau de Tour de Mons, uh, some time ago. 2014. Oh, yeah.
[00:12:36] Jackie: I'm so pretty.
[00:12:40] Sarah: I know. 
[00:12:42] Harry: It's like we're doing a job. It is. I 
[00:12:45] Jackie: know. I take it. 
[00:12:47] Harry: I don't know. It looks a little ironic. 
[00:12:49] Jackie: I was so tired from Mad Corp, I thought. I remember when I was, by the time I was walking home from the whole, this is, you know, I hadn't been walking so much for a while. Yeah. Now I'm 
[00:13:02] Matt: back, and I 
[00:13:03] Jackie: was welcomed by a therapist who was 91st.
He's supposed to tune well with me, which I haven't done. I've been doing him on Zoom for months. And then I walked to Broadway and Times Square to get my hair washed. And then from there, I walked all the way home. Wow. That's a 
[00:13:28] Matt: grand tour. Yeah. And by the 
[00:13:30] Jackie: time I got home, I thought, Oh my God, this is my dream job.
The phone rang. Yeah. And here I am. 
[00:13:38] Music: Uh huh. Oh. 
[00:13:39] Jackie: It's like. What a big day, yeah. We're not walking. I should've been walking sooner then. 
[00:13:46] Harry: Indeed. So, you're, like, if I had to dodge every time my mom says this. 
[00:13:52] Matt: Ready? 
[00:13:52] Jackie: Okay. 
[00:13:54] Matt: The later it gets, the more awake I get. Okay. It's amazing. 
[00:13:58] Jackie: That's what it's now. 
[00:13:59] Matt: It's like 
[00:13:59] Sarah: I tell, I just literally, yeah.
What, when do you pick pee? Like 8:00 PM What time is it now? 8:00 PM Yeah. Maybe. Yeah. Maybe a little. Maybe. 
[00:14:11] Music: Well, especi 50 eats good food. Eats good food. He hears good music. You got like, 
[00:14:18] Jackie: yeah. 
[00:14:21] Sarah: I'm not sure you get sleepy sometimes. Yeah. 
[00:14:24] Harry: Sarah, on the other hand. I 
[00:14:25] Sarah: do get sleepy sometimes. When I'm, like, I feel like I need to be very active.
I just dropped my phone. Oh, I might have, no, I might have tapped it. Very nice.
[00:14:47] Harry: I love a medium body dry.
[00:14:54] Jackie: You approve. 
[00:14:56] Matt: I approve, and I approve this wine.

Oh my God. That was, that was, uh, one for, they did one for them, one for you, whatever. That was one for me. 
[00:16:08] Jackie: It's so good. 
[00:16:09] Harry: It's so great. So

[00:16:42] Jackie: I misunderstood.
[00:16:43] Matt: And I'll have to serve her wrong. 
[00:16:45] Jackie: I'll have to 
[00:16:46] Matt: serve her wrong. Um, I'm going to have the duck 
[00:16:48] Harry: breast. Short ribs for me. Short ribs? Thank you. Duck breast or medium rare, is that okay? Yes. That was a 
[00:16:56] Matt: good question.

[00:16:58] Matt: bits here. What do you 
[00:16:58] Harry: need? 
[00:16:59] Sarah: Um, I think I'll have the, This is the roast chicken.
Can 
[00:17:05] Harry: you give me a tomato appetizer? Tomatoes? It 
[00:17:09] Sarah: looks good. 
[00:17:10] Harry: For the whole table? Yeah. You've just made comments in the past. 
[00:17:13] Jackie: Tomatoes? That 
[00:17:14] Harry: suggested you wouldn't order that. 
[00:17:16] Jackie: I know. Are we eating tomatoes? It's 
[00:17:18] Harry: starting. No. 
[00:17:21] Jackie: I know. Not even the ones in the garden that you were 
[00:17:24] Harry: Sierra's parents recently made, um, A bruschetta.
A bruschetta. A bruschetta. With, with tomatoes they grew. And 
[00:17:31] Music: they're, they're delicious. 
[00:17:32] Harry: Amazing tomatoes. They're really, really good. And they salted them, they, it was the, cause they salted them three minutes prior. It was the perfect salting technique. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And um, I ate them and I didn't even, it wasn't even like a, Oh, I can take this.
It was a, I'm getting, I'm getting joy from this. Which had never happened to me. 
[00:17:52] Jackie: City tomatoes, I've 
[00:17:53] Harry: anything awful. Tomatoes. 
[00:17:54] Jackie: They don't have any taste they've gotten, you know what it is? Yeah. You shouldn't be. Yeah. Maybe. 
[00:17:58] Harry: I love tomatoes more than everyone and I've just never gotten good enough tomatoes.
You are up here. We were all down here. Yeah. You 
[00:18:06] Jackie: won't like the ones who get, 
[00:18:08] Harry: I haven't for 28 years now. 
[00:18:10] Jackie: But did 
[00:18:11] Sarah: you, did you try the ones in might leave? 
[00:18:13] Harry: Yeah, I had the bruta. 
[00:18:14] Sarah: Oh, you liked it? 
[00:18:15] Harry: I had more pieces than everyone else. I started to feel bad about it, but I was so. I'm excited about the me liking tomatoes.
Yeah, yeah, 
[00:18:22] Matt: yeah. This is good for me. This is, yeah. 
[00:18:23] Harry: But then when I had those tomatoes, the same tomatoes, raw, in Maine, I just didn't like it. That was hard. So I think it was the, the salting. I think chopping, chopping it up. Yeah. 
[00:18:34] Jackie: I find that, that a mere garden grown tomato, I even hate it. 
[00:18:40] Sarah: Yeah, I agree. It Sometimes salt is nice, but it's 
[00:18:47] Jackie: Thank you.
[00:18:47] Sarah: Uh, 
[00:18:52] Jackie: yeah. Yeah. I love salt. Yeah. It is just Yeah. Popcorn. 
[00:18:58] Sarah: Yeah. 
[00:18:58] Music: Good hand feel? 
[00:19:01] Sarah: I think salt has iron in it. So that should be Maybe that's why I'm still alive. 
[00:19:06] Harry: You're still alive. Does salt have iron in it? N A C L. I think it's salt. 
[00:19:10] Sarah: I feel like it does. Or it's like how they make it, it ends up getting iron in it.
I remember, I remember this. Okay. Being a thing. And like, yeah. 
[00:19:18] Matt: I mean, it comes from either, it ultimately came from salt water. 
[00:19:23] Jackie: Yeah. 
[00:19:24] Harry: That is either cadassi or then, or limes. I didn't realize this because I'm reading the book. Salt that acid y. Oh, Sarah, would you like to, would you like to pitch your idea to my father?
No, I don't think 
[00:19:36] Sarah: I've pitched it a couple of times and you've rejected it. No, 
[00:19:39] Harry: Sarah's a very good idea. 
[00:19:40] Sarah: Really? You've been rejected? Okay. I just think when you do like she, she should present the recipes or like someone should do this where it's like you color code what the, what each ingredient is, salt, fat, acid, or heat.
And then, it just kind of, like, people kind of learn to cook more intuitively. I was just like, 
[00:19:58] Harry: you know. Using the category. So you can do lemon juice, you can do balsamic vinegar, anything. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so that's just like 
[00:20:02] Sarah: really fault, I think people can really, they follow recipes so strictly, they don't understand, like, why lemon juice is being added.
Because it needs an acid, you know? So, 
[00:20:11] Harry: have you read the book? 
[00:20:12] Sarah: No, I've seen it. I've, yeah. 
[00:20:15] Harry: Yeah. 
[00:20:16] Matt: So it's, it's kind of, um, academic in the sense that yeah, you know, there's a lot of preem, 
[00:20:22] Music: right? Yeah. So you read this book, it's about sort of food chemistry, basic food chemistry, 
[00:20:27] Waiter: but sort of for, you know, non crazy candy, but sort of like it's a 
[00:20:31] Jackie: value for 
[00:20:32] Waiter: salt.
What, what does salt do? What does salt actually do? What do they do to 
[00:20:35] Music: you? Not what they do to you, but they do the food. Yeah. 
[00:20:39] Waiter: Oh, they're dealing with, 
[00:20:40] Harry: oh, 
[00:20:41] Waiter: all about. Flavor. 
[00:20:43] Harry: Correct. The way that oil might carry a flavor in a way it can be infused with the flavor, the way that salt can have a chemical reaction with something in your chicken and make it taste different.
Yeah. Right. Exactly. And then heat 
[00:20:55] Matt: of 
[00:20:56] Harry: course. How, 
[00:20:56] Matt: how you cook, how long you cook it, kind of all that great stuff. Yeah. So, um, 
[00:21:05] Harry: um, so back to Sarah's idea, Sarah. I like your idea, but I think there needs to be one other part to it. 
[00:21:10] Sarah: Yeah, I agree. Which 
[00:21:11] Harry: is that. Like, if you read the book, it's like, she of course lays out salt, fat, acid, heat, which is the first of two, um, ways she educates you.
[00:21:22] Music: But then the second way, 
[00:21:24] Harry: is within each category, she explains, All the different minutia and why there's, why the different things in that category differentiate themselves. I agree. So I agree, 
[00:21:34] Sarah: yeah. 
[00:21:34] Harry: Then, then it's like, it would be nice to say like, give the actual ingredients, say we're recommending lemon juice here, color coded as acid, but say we're doing lemon juice because It's sweet as compared to vinegar, which is bitter, 
[00:21:46] Matt: you know.
[00:21:48] Harry: So it's sort of like, 
[00:21:50] Matt: It's like if you teach someone to fly, by giving them all the, this is how air behaves, and then when they get in the plane, they need to somehow understand that air behaves that way, but what is the, what instruments do I push to make the, make the wings 
[00:22:05] Harry: do the work? There's seven different lightweights out here, I suppose.
[00:22:09] Matt: And that's a little more fun. Right, Tim? You've 
[00:22:12] Jackie: already written this, uh, about Whitney. Written this. Have you written about it? Oh, 
[00:22:17] Sarah: no, 
[00:22:18] Jackie: I just threw 
[00:22:19] Sarah: out an idea. You're just making an idea. I love to make up an idea. But it would be interesting. I mean, you could go through the book and maybe highlight it. Like, underline or something.
You know, you could, like, test it out. The response 
[00:22:30] Harry: many people have had to Sarah is, it sounds like you've identified the basics of cooking as all cooks do it. Yeah. 
[00:22:37] Sarah: Everyone straight up sees the 
[00:22:38] Harry: ingredients and says, Oh, I could swap that with this. 
[00:22:42] Sarah: I think a lot of people don't view it that formally, like, I think a lot of people kind of, it's more instinctual.
They think of Rasputin, they know, it's more like an, an AI model, kind of being like, what is similar to this? Let me, like, find something similar. It's not as much, like, categorical, it's more like similar things. 
[00:22:58] Harry: I don't see that there's enough. There's enough? Yeah. 
[00:23:01] Waiter: You 
[00:23:02] Harry: know, one and one equals three, right?
Not everything is simply like, oh, when I put these 
[00:23:06] Music: two together, they each 
[00:23:08] Waiter: remain 
[00:23:08] Music: as Yeah, yeah, yeah, equally. Yeah. But when you put, like sweet and sour, right? Sour on its own, sweet on its own. But when you put those two together, Hello. Yeah, yeah, 
[00:23:19] Sarah: yeah, yeah. 
[00:23:20] Music: Very good. I'm surprised you didn't have sweet as one of the ingredients, 
[00:23:22] Harry: but I guess, I guess it's 
[00:23:24] Music: sweet.
[00:23:25] Harry: Well, sweet is a description. It's an adjective, it's not a noun. It's all fat, acid, either or noun. I think 
[00:23:32] Sarah: if you're cooking the Harry Shapiro recipe book, sweet would be, it would be salt, fat, acid, acid. Sweet. Because Harry adds maple syrup or honey to everything he makes. 
[00:23:44] Harry: You know, he gets money. I do. I'm sponsored.
Big honey. Big honey. Big honey. Perhaps you call this out because it's a rather unique relative to the Home Chef, but it's not unique relative to the chef. Almost every restaurant does that. Yeah, it's true. I only put a little bit. Yeah, I like if you were to compare the salt I put in to the sugar I put in.
[00:24:09] Sarah: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I just, I was just poking fun of you 
[00:24:13] Harry: but 
[00:24:14] Jackie: me blood.
[00:24:21] Harry: Now you now they say, 
[00:24:25] Jackie: now they say, no fault. 
[00:24:28] Matt: No, I, because your, your blood pressures is not 
[00:24:35] Jackie: well, but now I take, 
[00:24:37] Harry: your body needs salt. 
[00:24:40] Jackie: Now it's meditation. 
[00:24:41] Harry: What do you need? Lower blood pressure. So you can look to 92 
[00:24:46] Sarah: 93. 
[00:24:48] Harry: No, that's what I'm saying. You're 92, right? No. Oh, you're 93? Ah. Yeah. Except people my age say, Ah, I gotta have a little blood pressure so I can live to 93.
You're there. You're there. You're allowed 
[00:25:00] Matt: to get 93. 
[00:25:01] Sarah: They don't say 94. They say 93. 94. 
[00:25:05] Matt: I understand it. I get older. You 
[00:25:09] Harry: don't look a day older. I forget my age all the time. I never remember my age.
I 
[00:25:18] Matt: think, don't we all? Here's question I gonna ask you. How do you, how does feel? Mm-hmm . I think there's almost always 10 years. People almost never say they feel their age. They Oh, 
[00:25:33] Sarah: feel younger. Oh yeah. I would say I feel kind of like, I feel 30 ish. I feel 30 at times. 
[00:25:41] Harry: Yeah. Once you hit 35, that's when people reliably start saying, I feel younger than that.
It's just 
[00:25:47] Sarah: like regression to like 50. Regression to 40. Regression to 40. 
[00:25:50] Matt: OK. So that, yeah, the mathematical form of education, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Number rises. Yeah. 
[00:26:02] Jackie: When people were here in 93, they really take it aback. I don't know what to do. I don't know 
[00:26:11] Sarah: what to do. I don't know what to say. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. Congratulations. 
[00:26:17] Matt: I hope it's been okay. Yeah. 
[00:26:19] Sarah: What are your secrets? Yeah, there's a lot. 
[00:26:22] Jackie: So they, uh, I don't know, and when you experience it, it's like, how did I get here? 
[00:26:30] Sarah: Yeah. Do you have, are you, do, like, your siblings, are any of them still alive? No. 
[00:26:36] Jackie: Only 
[00:26:36] Music: one 
[00:26:37] Jackie: sibling. 
[00:26:37] Sarah: Only one sibling. Okay. I'm just wondering, is there any longevity, like, Um, 
[00:26:43] Jackie: I'm the 
[00:26:43] Sarah: youngest one.
[00:26:44] Jackie: No. Not 
[00:26:46] Matt: so. Or you're not so. No. No. No, he's my brother. How old is he? He's two thousand and eighty. Your mom's eighty. I have two grandmothers who are in their eighties. 
[00:27:00] Jackie: About. But 
[00:27:01] Matt: the grandfathers, one died. 
[00:27:03] Jackie: My brother was eighty. 
[00:27:06] Matt: And the other died. Not your mom. My mom's dad died when I was sixty. Right, like sixteen.
Alright, we got it.
[00:27:15] Sarah: Oh, really? I didn't know that. Family name. 
[00:27:18] Matt: Is Sam a family name? Both sides of the family. Um, yes. 
[00:27:23] Sarah: Yes, 
[00:27:24] Matt: so we have, um, Sam. What are we waiting for? Tomato. 
[00:27:31] Sarah: So now you're eating that.
[00:27:37] Matt: If I don't like it, you can 
[00:27:39] Jackie: Here 
[00:27:39] Matt: before. Mm-hmm . 
[00:27:42] Sarah: Yeah. It's also very close. It's very, as Google 
[00:27:46] Harry: described it, it's a,
[00:27:50] Matt: oh.
[00:27:58] Sarah: Oh, perfect. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well done. That was really good. Too much for you, Harry? Two tomatoes.
I actually think they did a pretty good job. Like, the The, um, basil is, you know, it's a lot of, but I do.
I agree. I think, I think the ones in way, the one way they're 
[00:28:27] Matt: better. Yeah. 
[00:28:32] Sarah: Talk about acid.
[00:28:42] Matt: The summers. 
[00:28:44] Sarah: Yeah, this is true. There's something really, yeah. 
[00:28:48] Harry: That's so good, 
[00:28:49] Sarah: Yu. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 
[00:28:52] Harry: Every summer. I have a great point. 
[00:28:53] Sarah: Mm-hmm. Great horse. 
[00:28:56] Jackie: I love, 
[00:28:58] Sarah: but I eat, 
[00:28:59] Jackie: I'll eat is, I'll eat, eat frozen corn. 
[00:29:03] Matt: Yeah. and I, I was saying I 
[00:29:06] Sarah: had three ears of corn last night. Destroyed. I could do for Forever
[00:29:13] Harry: Great America product. Yeah. One of the things we do best. 
[00:29:17] Sarah: Yeah. I think it's, you know, if you want to, if you wanna like keep your buying in America, support, you know, America Farms. Corn is probably good, 
[00:29:28] Matt: and the northeast is great to ride around because you know, we don't have the big massive, but we do have, 
[00:29:35] Sarah: yeah, we have corn.
Yeah. Corn and tomatoes, you know? Mm-hmm . We got those.
[00:29:46] Matt: So we've now, we don't oil it. But we put it in the oven. Oh. 
[00:29:55] Sarah: Oh. Does it get like char mark? So like when it gets crunchy, it doesn't get crunchy. Yeah. Do you guys 
[00:30:01] Matt: grill on your roof? 
[00:30:03] Sarah: Where's the grill? No, you get that cast 
[00:30:06] Matt: iron grill. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, 
[00:30:08] Sarah: of course. Yeah. Yeah. Harry's. Yeah. 
[00:30:12] Harry: No, 
[00:30:13] Sarah: it's definitely a city thing, right?
[00:30:15] Harry: No, it is. It isn't really. Yeah, 
[00:30:22] Sarah: it is. That's true. That's true. I don't 
[00:30:25] Matt: have 
[00:30:25] Harry: it all, Chris. I don't 
[00:30:28] Matt: have 
[00:30:29] Harry: it all, Chris. After, that would be the third thing I have in a kitchen. I would have one pot, one pan, and that's it. 
[00:30:37] Matt: I think, I 
[00:30:39] Jackie: think I'm 
[00:30:41] Matt: gonna try. I don't know. Is this kind of on the real deal? I 
[00:30:47] Harry: don't know.
[00:30:48] Matt: But then also you can't stop paying 
[00:30:49] Harry: for 
[00:30:49] Jackie: it. Don't the 
[00:30:51] Sarah: stoves 
[00:30:52] Jackie: come with grills now? 
[00:30:54] Sarah: Oh, I don't think, do stoves come with grills now? 
[00:30:57] Matt: Really? Oh, 
[00:31:02] Sarah: totally, yeah.
Yeah. 
[00:31:09] Harry: Yeah. This is, in my opinion, has to be the first thing you would upgrade an oven. I have always wanted an oven. 
[00:31:16] Sarah: Stove top? 
[00:31:16] Harry: I want a range. You want 
[00:31:18] Sarah: a range? What? What does range mean? 
[00:31:22] Matt: You don't need that. A 
[00:31:23] Sarah: lot 
[00:31:23] Matt: of people need 
[00:31:24] Sarah: that. Mm 
[00:31:25] Matt: hmm. Or if they do, they get smaller. 
[00:31:27] Sarah: I do need an oven. Given how many vegetables I've roast, I need an oven.
I'm a big, just, shower head. Well, I didn't 
[00:31:34] Harry: realize that range was, you know, I don't know. Exclusive. I just need like a really nice, like bowl or something. Yeah. Full. Full. 
[00:31:40] Sarah: What does, what does gran mean? 
[00:31:42] Harry: I guess I don't, it's the, the burn. 
[00:31:45] Sarah: Oh, okay. The burn. 
[00:31:47] Harry: So you get, I would make three kids stay in a bedroom before I gave up a good kitchen.
They would thank you for,
I've also, I pitched the idea, didn't get a positive response, but. Where you have a really, really small space, but you have a kitchen that's big, great for cooking, and you can entertain within it. 
[00:32:16] Sarah: No, I'm not opposed. I, I, yeah, I agree. I 
[00:32:21] Jackie: agree. My apartment. Oh really? Yeah. The TV room should be the kitchen. Oh, and the kitchen could be a third bedroom.
Yeah. Yeah. I see that your kitchen's kind of small. Yeah, but that's No. Yeah. Yeah. That was made that apartment. Yeah. People who buy 
[00:32:42] Sarah: probably will do that. No, I agree. I think, yeah. I mean, in New York, kitchens aren't as like central because there's so much dining out, but I, I like it. It's like the heart of the kitchen.
Yeah, it's very, yeah, I like it, yeah. And then whoever gets, whoever's cooking is in the middle of things, which I think is good. Other being like, I think it's too much like shut away otherwise, yeah. And you're doing the work and you're often, you know, like very like central to the 
[00:33:08] Jackie: That's why we say God bless the chef.
God bless the 
[00:33:11] Sarah: chef, yeah. Yeah, yeah. It says, I heard 
[00:33:15] Matt: from a woman who's, uh, who's a City 
[00:33:19] Jackie: College student involved in the public schools, the primary school, and she 
[00:33:25] Matt: would have 
[00:33:26] Jackie: these sessions, 
[00:33:27] Matt: and she's the one that said, you 
[00:33:31] Jackie: have to tell your family before they do anything, God bless the show. God bless the show, yeah.
God bless, just God bless the show. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What? 
[00:33:42] Sarah: No, I think it's good. And sometimes people do, um, We were just in Maine with a bunch of my friends, and some people Some people are 
[00:33:53] Music: Some 
[00:33:53] Sarah: people are more like like, have more gratitude than others for whoever cooked the meal, whoever did the dishes, whoever did any labor, and I think it was good to take a moment and be like We're gonna practice some gratitude, you know.
It might not be, it might not be on your mind, but we're gonna make it on your minds. 
[00:34:10] Harry: No, sorry Harry. Harry is remarkably good at the speech giving, like 
[00:34:19] Sarah: casual speech 
[00:34:20] Harry: giving, 
[00:34:21] Sarah: in a way that 
[00:34:24] Harry: like 
[00:34:25] Sarah: a lot of people are not gonna be grateful for. Feel that comfortable doing. I'm not gonna say things as like crisp.
[00:34:37] Matt: Will could do it. Lola could do it. 
[00:34:39] Sarah: Lola could do. It will, right? Yeah. This is not, yeah. 
[00:34:44] Matt: Get the video I sent about the guy people already. People 
[00:34:52] Sarah: clean. People cook. 
[00:34:54] Matt: I can send it to you. Oh, I 
[00:34:55] Sarah: don't know if I want to see it 
[00:34:57] Matt: though. Stand up. I'll show it to you, but I'll just, it's a standup comedian. I don't know, I don't know why, I just don't understand.
And he's, it's a very short bit, it's what, 50 seconds, you know what I'm saying? It is quite complete in this. And he starts out going, There are people who clean, people who suck. And there are people who think that people who clean, it's a fair trade. I'm doing cooking, you're doing cleaning. And I'm here on behalf of the cleaning people to show you, it is not!
[00:35:27] Sarah: Yeah, I agree. I agree it is not. Because cooking, you have creative direction. It's fun. You're like a painter. You're having so much, you're making something. 
[00:35:36] Waiter: Can I respond? It's like being in the engine room versus being the pilot. If you're like steering the boat, you're doing a great job. 
[00:35:43] Sarah: Yeah. 
[00:35:44] Waiter: Or the guys in the bottom shoving coal.
[00:35:48] Sarah: No, I agree. It's stressful. It's stressful, but they're, yeah. Yeah, but they're not 
[00:35:52] Matt: equal. What about, what about clean dishes? Clean dishes? Never can say, oh, I tried this new dish cleaning technique. , right? Yeah. It's never, yeah, it's drudgery. Nothing. There's nothing, nothing. We're cooking. Be for. Yeah. Or it could be like, and anyway, thank you.
Typically goes to the 
[00:36:18] Sarah: chef? No, no, no. The cleaning group. It's kind of quiet, silent labor, you know?
What I try to make happen, though, is have a dinner table that's still, like, raucous and dramatic, and people do, like, not just, like, maybe, not, you know, just, like, there's drama. And then the people who can clean can discuss the drama after. You know, so it's a good, like, that's your condolence prize is, like, you get to 
[00:36:43] Harry: gossip.
Because only one person fits in my kitchen, so I always wanted people after dinner to be cleaning together. It's a continuation of the dinner. Many hands make life work. The dishes go quickly. Yeah. But people can't fit in my kitchen. Yeah. Yeah. Your 
[00:36:59] Sarah: kitchen and people do it and it's through. Yeah. My kitchen.
Yeah. Well, you, you can't escape the kitchen. Yeah. You, if you see like, it's like you can't be like. You can't like not see someone cleaning and if you see someone cleaning you're like I should help. Yeah 
[00:37:11] Jackie: Your apartment in brooklyn 
[00:37:13] Sarah: in brooklyn. Yeah, it's quite it's quite big. There's a yeah Very central island 
[00:37:22] Harry: I do about a third of the cleaning wall cooking as well.
Yeah So I just want to make that caveat for the cooking the cleaning dichotomy. It's not really much of a dichotomy Doing a third of the cleaning I understand that it's called drudgery. But it's 
[00:37:40] Sarah: one of the things you 
[00:37:43] Harry: appreciate. I 
[00:37:44] Sarah: do a lot of cleaning and cooking. And 
[00:37:49] Harry: I would also say the judgment.
Sarah gets judged by one person. But I get judged by everyone who ate. Wait, who gets judged? 
[00:37:57] Sarah: Me. You get judged. The person is a scoundrel. 
[00:38:01] Harry: When you touch food. When you touch food. For the plate cover, there's just still a layer of grease on it. That's my only 
[00:38:11] Jackie: plus. If it goes in the dishwasher I have a 
[00:38:14] Harry: dishwasher.
This is my dishwasher. Or 
[00:38:17] Matt: this is my dishwasher. 
[00:38:20] Sarah: Pretty bad dishwasher. 
[00:38:21] Matt: Yeah. I got the little dishwasher right here. The little dishwasher. 
[00:38:24] Sarah: Dishwasher dish. You should start calling me dishwasher. See, in your apartment 
[00:38:28] Jackie: you have a dishwasher. 
[00:38:29] Sarah: We do. Yeah. Yeah. We have a lot of appliances. Yeah. I've never lived in an apartment on our dishwasher.
I feel like it's a rite of passage and I just, yeah, I did. Really? Yeah. 
[00:38:43] Jackie: Even on West End, well, in the village. No. Oh, my Yu lived on Morton Street. I mean, they had converted a closet into a kitchen and another closet into a bathroom. Wow. But one, the living room looked out on, uh,
on Morton and the back looked out on all these gardens that the brown, 
[00:39:09] Sarah: yeah. It's nice. 
[00:39:12] Jackie: And I wouldn't be happy to stay there forever. 
[00:39:16] Sarah: Yeah. 
[00:39:17] Matt: This is the classic. Yeah. I think this is, for the quintessential, this is the beginning of Jackie Sparrow. I don't, I don't want to like, don't make me do things here.
Like, I don't mind. That sounds, that seems like a lot of, you know, activity and movement. Yeah, yeah. Wait, moving? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I like where I am. I like the things that surround me. I like Now, don't 
[00:39:40] Jackie: think I can play basketball because 
[00:39:43] Matt: I'm so tall. 
[00:39:45] Jackie: In high school, you know, all the rules decided I said, Calm 
[00:39:52] Matt: down.
Math seems like a lot of fun. 
[00:39:56] Sarah: Calm down, yeah. But There 
[00:40:04] Jackie: are other things in the world that 
[00:40:09] Matt: Yeah. I mean, like, if that's your goal too, right, and you're, and you're where you want to be, I mean, this guy comes along, and now you've got your family, so that's the first time you've like, changed your

Yeah, they got We have it all. We 
[00:50:16] Sarah: have a, we have a dehydrator. 
[00:50:20] Matt: What's a dehydrator? 
[00:50:21] Sarah: My mom made beef jerky once. It was so good. And then we make, like 
[00:50:25] Harry: Have you seen it? No, but they can't really do very 
[00:50:29] Sarah: Yeah, it's like a microwave. They can't do much. 
[00:50:32] Harry: But my dad has so much jerky. Okay. I mean, 
[00:50:34] Sarah: you got really into jerky, maybe.
But, like, it's You can't do that much. You can, like, dry apples out. Oranges out. 
[00:50:41] Matt: And Cherokee, I think relies more on their process. 
[00:50:49] Harry: I don't think, I don't think it's moisture, man. Yeah. Yeah. I want to, um, much smaller and more attainable. I want a So beef. What's that?
When you sue the uh, uh. It's a heating technique, where you put the food in a plastic bag, and you drop it in water that's warm, but not like boiling, and you let it sit there for a long time, and it slow cooks in this, in this very even heat, because it's water, so it's even on all sides. 
[00:51:31] Jackie: Okay, so what kind of food do you want?
[00:51:33] Harry: I don't know. People do, any kind of meat is really good with it. Because it gets very like, fall off the bone, tender, flaky. So like a, a short rib would be a really good option. That's something you would want in a sukiyaki. I've eaten it before. I've eaten it. What this, the short rib I just had probably was 
[00:51:52] Sarah: sukiyaki.
And what's the, what machine does this? 
[00:51:56] Harry: You literally just put it in a pot with water, and there's a machine you put in the pot as well. Um. That heats the water to like a hundred and fifty, a hundred and twenty degrees. Cause like a 
[00:52:06] Sarah: stove won't like, won't do that. It's hard to keep it constant for that long.
[00:52:11] Harry: It's energy inefficient.
[00:52:16] Sarah: Interesting.
[00:52:25] Matt: Timing. Right. They're always looking for, 
[00:52:28] Sarah: yeah. True. Yeah. 
[00:52:28] Matt: Ingredients close.

[00:53:06] Music: Protein.

[00:53:13] Matt: play club. Please play club.
[00:53:24] Sarah: Well, I had two full ones. It was really a lot of 
[00:53:30] Harry: food. You

[00:53:44] Jackie: you. Did you have 
[00:53:49] Music: a
[00:53:57] Sarah: clean plate club growing up? Was that a thing? 
[00:53:59] Harry: So 
[00:54:01] Sarah: did 
[00:54:02] Harry: we! What was the hardest thing with us eating? I heard it was picky, right? I heard it was picky, but I don't think it was picky for a long time. For me, 
[00:54:18] Jackie: I have no 
[00:54:19] Harry: memory of what the food was like. Everything I can remember, I feel like I ate a 
[00:54:24] Jackie: lot of 
[00:54:26] Music: food.
Yeah. 
[00:54:30] Harry: Sam's kind of picky, but not in a bratty way. No, he, because he's sort of got a principal pickiness. Yeah, he doesn't, you know, when you're eating the red meats. Now wait, he also doesn't, like, most Yeah, Sam doesn't really like fruit. He's, he's not going to like gag. But he like, if you put it in front of him, he's not going to eat it.
Yeah, he's not going to eat it if you put it in front of him. Fritz? 
[00:55:01] Sarah: Polenta? 
[00:55:07] Harry: Polenta.
I love polenta. 
[00:55:22] Sarah: Me too. That's probably why I ordered it. 
[00:55:24] Harry: Polenta's a great, cheap food. I get the, the, the log of polenta, and I fry slices of it like it's bologna. It's so good. Really cheap. Really cheap. So what's in it besides polenta? Very little else. Yeah, it's like some, they put some, like some spices in, and I think usually if you get it at a store, like some preserve it is.
Mmm.
[00:55:57] Jackie: So are you able, you're still not having to work in Long 
[00:56:00] Sarah: City? Yeah, no, I, I mean I can go, like, there's an office there when I want to go in, I can go in. They give me lunch and they give me whatever, but I don't have to. So I don't, I don't, I can't concentrate when I'm in there. I'm so aware of everyone around me.
Like I can't do any work. I also found 
[00:56:20] Harry: out that there are, 
[00:56:22] Sarah: yeah, 
[00:56:22] Harry: my 
[00:56:23] Sarah: two roommates, one half 
[00:56:26] Harry: the 
[00:56:27] Sarah: time. So, people around. Being in the 
[00:56:32] Jackie: room. 
[00:56:33] Sarah: Yeah, no, it is. I sometimes, and when they're talking, I'm like, 
[00:56:36] Matt: I 
[00:56:37] Sarah: have to put my headphones on because I can't concentrate. But, it's also kind of nice. You know, it's like more of a, you tell people about your days.
Yeah. You 
[00:56:45] Harry: went 
[00:56:46] Sarah: into an office when you worked 
[00:56:50] Harry: in the, the textile, 
[00:56:53] Sarah: place, 
[00:56:54] Harry: okay, yeah. 
[00:56:56] Sarah: Did you like it? Did you like going in? It's 
[00:56:58] Harry: dehydrating. Oh yeah! I think if you have a 
[00:57:01] Sarah: friend, it's probably really nice. You know? And then there's another woman that I'm not 
[00:57:05] Jackie: in 
[00:57:05] Sarah: college 
[00:57:06] Harry: with. Yeah. Exactly. Once I read the ingredients, I'm just so used to buying them off.
So then I 
[00:57:13] Sarah: was like, this culture. 
[00:57:14] Harry: Exactly. Yeah. So once I read the ingredients, I realized it's just a 
[00:57:17] Sarah: 50 50. You have to be around people that you wouldn't normally be around. And that can take a I was like, why don't I just 
[00:57:23] Harry: buy cornflour and flour and I'll make some scratch and it'll probably be better.
And 
[00:57:28] Sarah: I'll 
[00:57:29] Harry: probably just do that, maybe add some sugar or some 
[00:57:31] Sarah: salt, whatever. But it makes you want to talk more. Slightly 
[00:57:33] Harry: tweak it. You know, that like, it only 
[00:57:35] Sarah: encourages the bond. 
[00:57:36] Harry: You look at them next year, they'll do so. The chip is definitely, it's like Betty Crockford's, like, Jumpin High. 
[00:57:45] Sarah: Yeah? Yeah, no, that was I don't have any 
[00:57:47] Harry: ingredients.
Nope. Oh, 
[00:57:49] Sarah: I 
[00:57:50] Harry: also want to try making them big. I like 
[00:57:51] Sarah: that, I like that. I heard that she asked your permission. Guess 
[00:57:54] Harry: mom would always make the small ones. That sounds really hard, but I want try making the like full pancake side. Yeah. Interesting. 
[00:58:04] Jackie: Had the most wonderful. Yeah, 
[00:58:07] Harry: but you gotta get more air out too.
[00:58:09] Jackie: Yeah. 
[00:58:10] Harry: Um, I get more of like a soup day kind of. 
[00:58:14] Jackie: It'll be hard not having her in the world. But now, I don't 
[00:58:18] Harry: No, but you could add some bacon chips. Or whatever it is that 
[00:58:22] Sarah: rises. Yeah. Yes, yeah, yeah. 
[00:58:25] Harry: No, but when I looked up in recipes for Yes, it is, yeah. For Johnnycakes. 
[00:58:29] Sarah: Yeah. 
[00:58:29] Harry: A lot of them would include it. 
[00:58:32] Music: So, 
[00:58:34] Harry: I think other people are doing it, but the kid did it next to me.
[00:58:37] Sarah: I don't know. I mean, 
[00:58:39] Harry: you can tell, because they don't, they don't rest. 
[00:58:41] Jackie: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And now, she's actually dead. She had a case in New York a couple weeks ago. She 
[00:58:55] Matt: had a case. She had a case. Yeah. Later this lunch or there's something else? Yeah. 
[00:59:01] Jackie: Well, we, we, uh, we talked about the people that she introduced me to.
I know it was midnight. My friend. Yeah. I can't say. 
[00:59:11] Sarah: Yeah, I mean that goes on. You know, even if this person's past, it's still so much there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, we've 
[00:59:22] Jackie: had a very tumultuous life in a lot 
[00:59:28] Harry: of places. Yeah. 
[00:59:30] Jackie: Her husband died in her apartment. He was just a living room on the couch.
Oh my god. 
[00:59:37] Sarah: Yeah. So she felt 
[00:59:40] Jackie: guilty about that for a while. 
[00:59:42] Sarah: Was there any reason? Their marriage was falling 
[00:59:46] Jackie: apart. 
[00:59:46] Sarah: Yeah. 
[00:59:48] Jackie: But, you know what she called, of course she called up and said, I think, uh, I think, uh, Oh, I don't remember her 
[01:00:01] Matt: name. 
[01:00:03] Jackie: David. I think David is dead. What? Oh. 
[01:00:10] Music: And 
[01:00:10] Jackie: indeed he 
[01:00:12] Music: was. And so 
[01:00:13] Jackie: the thing to do was call out that he knew about people who died.
Father died. 
[01:00:20] Harry: Who knew about people who died. He was aware it could happen. He had read stories. I 
[01:00:25] Sarah: know. Yeah. 
[01:00:26] Harry: Eat, 
[01:00:29] Jackie: I mean, that's 
[01:00:32] Matt: can't.
Their food that I didn't like.
[01:00:48] Sarah: Sorry,
[01:01:02] Matt: question 
[01:01:05] Sarah: my sister. Um. That's a good question. She is finishing her finals right now in London. She just, we were on the phone, she texted me and she was like, She's like, how good is New York actually? She lived here two, yeah, she lived here for two years, like two years, like, uh, two years ago? She lived here for two years, and, three years ago, and she, L like was okay with it, but she also worked in this like plastic surgery place.
Like I don't think it was really her vibe and like I think she was very exposed to this like version of New York that was like very like, 
[01:01:40] Music: why?
[01:01:47] Sarah: Yeah, it was. Yeah. But like I think, I think the, like the, it also 
[01:01:50] Harry: was a toxic workplace. 
[01:01:51] Sarah: That's the, yeah. It was a toxic workplace. And also. A 
[01:01:54] Harry: toxic workplace. A lot of mean women who, you know. 
[01:01:59] Sarah: Who did, yeah. And a lot of like, emphasis on like, how you look, and wealth, and like, whatever. That like, New York has, that's a side of New York.
And I think it's like, it's not a comfortable side for Yeah. And like, it shouldn't be like, awesome. We, we didn't, you know, we don't come from that world. And so it's whatever. But she, she said, she's like, she wants a high quality of living, which Harry and I were taught. Yeah. And I just think like, you have to kind 
[01:02:26] Jackie: of, well, what does that 
[01:02:27] Sarah: mean?
I 
[01:02:28] Music: know. 
[01:02:30] Sarah: I think, I think she wants. She wants like a, like a nice kitchen and like, yeah,
yeah, this is true Jackie, but you are, you are an exceptional kind of person. Story. You are very lucky
[01:02:53] Jackie: this, 
[01:02:55] Matt: but think about, think about when
you living 
[01:03:01] Harry: in a small apartment, grand at the next, Catherine could live in a small apartment in Greenville. It should be happy. Yeah. 
[01:03:07] Sarah: Catherine would live in like. She would, yeah, she decide the money to small parking 
[01:03:13] Music: grad school. Yeah. 
[01:03:14] Sarah: It's really expensive to live here as a young person. Like you need to be making
[01:03:25] Harry: relative. Yeah. It's legitimately probably 10 times more expensive. Adjusted for I think you, yeah. You have 
[01:03:36] Sarah: to work in finance probably to do that. Or consulting. Yeah. 
[01:03:41] Harry: Like, that apartment is probably 38, 000 square feet right now. Yeah. That's awesome. You're an art student. 
[01:03:49] Music: Oh, 
[01:03:49] Harry: good. That's 
[01:03:51] Matt: a nice building.
Yeah. That's really great. I'd 
[01:03:53] Jackie: love to have a garden in the 
[01:03:56] Matt: back of the school. That would be a 
[01:04:00] Jackie: great thing. We live here for like, a year. A year? Yeah. Oh, my. 
[01:04:07] Sarah: When you were born, I was born in Madagascar. Oh, yeah, Matt. 
[01:04:14] Matt: He, who's he? 
[01:04:17] Harry: Yeah, I was zero to one. Sarah lived in North Carolina for those years. 
[01:04:23] Sarah: I did, yeah.
Don't remember a thing, I'm sure you do. You don't either. Um, 
[01:04:29] Jackie: they were working in in, 
[01:04:32] Sarah: yeah. My parents, yeah. One, well, one was in school. They were both working. One was working at the CD, C and the other one was working for Fauci. For fci. I think at a co-op. Some 
[01:04:42] Jackie: they were not. 
[01:04:44] Sarah: No, my biological mom had her PhD.
So she was working in the CDC, and I think doing somewhat academic work. Like a lot of probably reading papers. Yeah, they met when they were, um, Like, I think, 26? One was the other one's, uh, what's it called? TA. Teacher assistant, so in college they met. Like, one was a grad student in college, teaching a class.
And then the other one was in the class and they met there. So, 
[01:05:11] Harry: and they're They're 66? 
[01:05:15] Sarah: Yeah. 66 and 64. 
[01:05:17] Harry: Older than my parents. By a couple years. Yeah. Yes. 
[01:05:23] Matt: Yes they are.
So 
[01:05:30] Harry: when sit here 
[01:05:32] Sarah: decide, well, she's gonna come home. 
[01:05:34] Harry: Well, your mom was pushing for Pittsburgh, right? Yeah, 
[01:05:37] Sarah: Philly. Philly. Um, 
[01:05:40] Jackie: I know! 
[01:05:44] Sarah: I think of, I think of, I, yeah. I don't think it's a bad idea for her. I think she needs, I think she just needs like a partner. Like, and she's dating someone now, but I don't think he's the perfect fit for her.
And I want her to find someone who's a really good fit for her. And then I think, she could live anywhere, and she could be happy. Like, she doesn't have like, A lot of people have like, deep needs in life. They need to be successful. They need a like, whatever. They need a really aesthetic life. They need a like She doesn't need that.
She needs She needs like a good partner. Yeah. 
[01:06:16] Jackie: But I 
[01:06:19] Music: think Yeah. 
[01:06:22] Sarah: But I think it's Yeah. She 
[01:06:29] Harry: just needs to feel I think it's true. It's tricky for her because she presents as like a normal, pretty woman. 
[01:06:40] Sarah: No it is. 
[01:06:41] Harry: But, 
[01:06:41] Sarah: yeah. But she's much more interesting and like, 
[01:06:44] Harry: There's much more under the hood there, but it's also not like so wild and interestingly creative that it's like immediately apparent.
[01:06:52] Sarah: No, oh yeah, or that would appeal to someone who is really interesting and creative. Yeah, exactly. Like it's like, she's kind of straddling a, If you talk to someone who's like, 
[01:06:58] Harry: you know, there's something going on here. There is a unique personality. You have to be with Katherine for longer to realize that.
[01:07:07] Sarah: Yeah. 
[01:07:07] Harry: And so it's, it's, it's, yeah. And 
[01:07:09] Sarah: she also hides it in a way where I'm very confident about it. Quiet, but just like, she's just a little more like a little more normal or, you know, like she, she, she presents herself in a certain way. She wears certain clothes. To like, does her hair in a certain way.
That is a little more like on trend. What? Like on trend. Like how, like how everyone else is dressing in fashion. Yeah, 
[01:07:35] Harry: yeah. So, yeah, it's tricky. You have to find someone who would be initially attracted to her. Yeah. But then also as she learns more about her, remain attracted to her. Mm-hmm . Uh, and there was a bit of a ballooning, like a flower.
[01:07:48] Music: Yeah. 
[01:07:48] Harry: I've been through that process. So, um, yeah. Yeah. I feel like I said that about her, like, two years ago. I was like, we need Captain to find love. 
[01:07:59] Sarah: Wait. I have an idea. What about George? Oh, I actually really like that. Yeah. I just thought about that now. George was someone who, we went to Maine with our, our friend's friend we'd never met before.
He's a sociologist and he's, he was the one in the photo of Harry sailing. He's a really great, warm guy. He's on top of it. And 
[01:08:21] Harry: Boston would be a good city for Siskelberg. I agree. I agree. I want to talk to Duke about it though. Because he would know the best. Yeah. Duke is the friend we've known ever since.
[01:08:36] Matt: Yeah. 
[01:08:41] Sarah: Have you ever set anyone up?
[01:08:46] Jackie: Yeah, yeah. It's an art. I would say that. I really would, yeah. 
[01:08:52] Sarah: Were you, did you leave feeling insulted? This is how I often leave feeling after I've been set up. Me too. This was, um, 
[01:09:01] Jackie: Lori's recent husband. 
[01:09:03] Sarah: Oh god. Yeah. 
[01:09:06] Jackie: So we were both, Lori and I were 
[01:09:08] Music: both, 
[01:09:10] Sarah: Yeah. So you went on a date with him first, and then Lori went on a date with him?
[01:09:15] Music: Yes. It 
[01:09:20] Matt: was tough.
[01:09:28] Jackie: Husband.

[01:09:53] Matt: So happy.
Where did they go to?
[01:10:06] Harry: His father owns a factory 
[01:10:10] Jackie: lives in Long Island. 
[01:10:13] Harry: I was making a joke. My first father died when I was about five. 
[01:10:21] Jackie: Yeah. It was not a good thing. It was not a good thing. But, yeah. And then, yeah. And then we all sort 
[01:10:31] Matt: of went out together. You know. 
[01:10:37] Harry: And 
[01:10:39] Jackie: then we all decided to get married. 
[01:10:42] Harry: Next day. 
[01:10:43] Jackie: Just like 
[01:10:44] Music: that.
[01:10:45] Harry: We'd like to move. Welcome.
[01:11:12] Sarah: I doubt it, but we'll.
[01:11:19] Harry: Unfortunately, you cannot have one without the other. 
[01:11:22] Jackie: How are you going to find someone? I hope the world will change for 
[01:11:28] Sarah: you. Whoever dies first. Whoever dies first. 
[01:11:31] Matt: Who 
[01:11:32] Sarah: do you want to die first? If we were to marry, whatever, and live our lives together. Who do you think we better die first? 
[01:11:40] Harry: Oh, I hope I die.
I know. That was a good question. 
[01:11:46] Sarah: Yeah, I'd be okay with that, I'd say because you would get a little coda. Yeah. Yeah. I be one year younger. Yeah.
[01:11:58] Matt: Um, what would I do after you?
[01:12:04] Sarah: Well, I think my, my twin sister was so alive like the sisters. Story, whatever it'll be. Okay. 
[01:12:14] Matt: Sorry. 
[01:12:16] Sarah: Um, I'm still picking a little bit, but Yeah.

[01:13:06] Jackie: Thing about him, he
spent night does, oh, that's a little, 
[01:13:20] Matt: that's a little bit of a exaggerate. I'm not sure that's exactly. There's something to that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, maybe 
[01:13:28] Harry: it was a cat. I don't like 
[01:13:31] Music: it. Really? 
[01:13:31] Harry: No, no, nothing negative. I'm just like, sometimes it's nice just to be by yourself. Um, who else do we think?

[01:13:39] Sarah: don't know.
Me. I'm like, I'm not as warm as Bobby. No, I agree. I agree. Why would you sleep alone when you could, Yeah, I actually think it's such a pity that like so many people sleep like it's like when you're sleeping if you're such in a vulnerable pure Space and like so few people witness that you know, it's like only you're like partner or maybe like your family like but like it's like it's such like a Yeah, I don't know humans are so pure and like vulnerable and innocent Say when they're sleeping.
I think it's a good for the witness.
[01:14:16] Harry: Yeah. Even if he snores. 
[01:14:20] Sarah: Yeah, if he actually he snores. That might change
you. Snore.

Yeah. If I try and grab onto my back, 
[01:14:57] Harry: I can't do it. Yeah, I can't believe you have this inclination to be on your back. It's not inclination, it's just sleep. I, I can't, every time I try Sleep on my back if it would be better because I try to go to sleep like that. Yeah. That says this. During this, during your sleep, you're on your side this amount of time.
