[00:00:00] Pierce: There's like, definitely like, good and bad things in both lifestyles, and it's not like the like, It's not as It doesn't sound super fun. Like, it's not like a like, Oh, it's a utopia, and everything's, you know, blah, blah, blah. Um, but then at the end I felt like it kind of like, pivoted, and you see a lot more of what the like, bad stuff is on the capitalist world and all those things.
Um, and felt that she did a very made a very compelling case for the thought that, um, Essentially, scarcity is required for equality. 
[00:00:28] Sarah: And 
[00:00:29] Pierce: I'm curious if that was something that you would agree with, and if so, like, would it be possible to have a world like their world, with abundance? 
[00:00:38] Lola: With abundance. That's a 
good 
question.
[00:00:43] Alexa: I mean, I want to say yes so badly because, like, I just imagine if everyone had, like, a real spirit of generosity, and, like, whatever was, like, around them in their community. You would be excited, like, sharing would be so exciting. You gotta be like, Oh my god, you have, like, this thing. Or like, if we had, if we had, like, cool relationships with other countries where, uh, wherever pineapples come from, we would, like, they would be like, We have this pineapple we want to give you.
And we'd be like, Oh my god, we have this crap we want to give you. Like, check this out. I feel like it's more like a mental, like, a mental switch that has to be made. That you have to be like excited about it. I don't know if this is even a real answer. Like, I just want to believe so hard that there's a world where people can be excited about being deaf.
[00:01:32] Sarah (2): Yeah. 
[00:01:33] Alexa: I think it's possible. I think it's possible. But I don't know, I don't know what has to happen for that to be so. Because, it's like, what, like, why does having all of the stuff around you create a scarcity mindset that makes you think, you 
[00:01:47] Sarah (2): know. Why? Yeah. 
[00:01:48] Jake: I'm thinking about the names. Like, no, nobody can have the same name on Aries.
Which is like another form of scarcity. Because, like, there's an abundance of Jakes in the world, you know. And there's like a loss of ideas. I don't know, it feels very mixed up and backwards to me, because I would think that equality and, like, abundance would be, more, would go more hand in hand. But I guess I'm wondering, like, what, what other themes do we, do we see where, like, the scarcity is actually, like, a key part of the culture?
Like I'm thinking about the rooms that they use, like how you don't, you don't have anything so you like all use the same stuff. 
[00:02:33] Sarah: Yeah. 
[00:02:33] Jake: Cause like if you didn't have to use communal housing, would everybody I mean, maybe that's a good point to get into right there, is the housing. Cause they could build as many homes as they needed for all the people, but that's not how it works.
Because they, it's like almost forced into They're forced into sharing somehow. 
[00:02:54] Pierce: There was, yeah, through equality. There was that line, um, that said, like, about how, like, one of the only resources they do have an abundance of is the electricity because of, like, solar. There was, like, some specific way where they're, like, we have this, but we don't ever do much, like, air conditioning or, like, temperature regulation.
And, like, I think the line, something along the lines of, like, um, because, like, sustainability is so It's so inherent to our way of life, it can't just be an aesthetic. And I thought that that was like, I felt very convicting of like, sustainability as an aesthetic versus a way of where it's like, you have to be sustainable across the board.
Even if in this one avenue we don't technically have to, but like if we start giving ourselves the luxury of like, oh it's like super cold inside even though it's hot outside, is that going to change our behavior in these other avenues and make the whole system warmer? Yeah. 
[00:03:41] Sarah (2): I feel like there's probably like an internal way that we are and like, like you get trained, like if there isn't an, if you're only out working on like the bare substance level, like whatever you need to like kind of like base survive, you never like know to want more.
I think it's like, it's like the brain maybe like trains itself to be like, this is all I want. Like there's no idea of like wanting, I think. And maybe they just like, they don't like, you just never encounter that. That's never like a narrative in your head. Like, I think, you know, we, we grow up and like someone has like a lot of something you like, you're jealous or whatever.
And then you like, you learn to, to want it within yourself. It's such like a socialized desire to like accumulate. Um, yeah, yeah. 
[00:04:27] Alexa: What if everyone was like sent to some like NRST like boarding school up until like, I don't know, they were like 17 and then they graduated. Yeah, where there was like extra resources like with, I wonder if they would like be able to carry the five over to be like, we can just like, we have more to play with here so we can like be more creative.
What 
[00:04:48] Jake: does abundance even mean in the context of like, no property? 
[00:04:55] Alexa: Yeah, that's a good question. 
[00:04:58] Jake: Like they have, like you were saying, the abundance of electricity, but it's not an abundance if it's not being owned by somebody. So I feel like an abundance is like naturally a proprietary and like, Label or quality of something.
[00:05:17] Sarah: So 
[00:05:17] Jake: I could, could, they were abundant in something, or like they could have had the ability to be abundant in electricity, but they like could allow that. This is almost like the concept doesn't 
[00:05:30] Alexa: Well, I feel like the abundance that I'm interested in is like variety. Cause like, they don't really, like they eat the same thing for like every meal pretty much.
Yeah. Which is 
[00:05:38] Sarah (2): funny. Well, yeah. I think that's another thing like, um, without like, a lot of like, do you have art? Do you have expression? Do you have variation? 
[00:05:45] Sarah: Yeah, 
[00:05:46] Sarah (2): yeah. As well. Like that feels like another thing that kind of gets sacrificed. Like 
[00:05:48] Alexa: do they make art there? I don't know. I don't think so. They have like the music, but it's like 
[00:05:52] Sarah: a This morning?
Kind of. Well, 
[00:05:55] Jake: they They, like, uh, crucified Tyrion. 
[00:05:59] Sarah: Yeah. 
[00:05:59] Jake: For his art. Yeah, 
[00:06:00] Lola: yeah, 
[00:06:01] Jake: yeah. Right? Like, they sent him to the loony bin on some island and, like, completely ostracized him and, like, convinced everybody that he was crazy. So there's, like, some art that's okay. But, some art that's like really 
[00:06:16] Sarah: not, 
which 
[00:06:18] Jake: feels really, uh,
like that, that would be an abundance to me, if he was allowed to, like, have his art played, because his play would play fine and, and her as well. I feel like, you know,
[00:06:40] Alexa: I know their books are about the same, right? I 
thought that was a strange 
detail that all, like, all of the 
[00:06:45] Alexa: books on Anna Aris had the, like, flower of life on the cover. Yeah, so it's like, I don't, like, what does that, what does that even signify? Do they have different 
[00:06:54] Sarah (2): titles? Huh? They have different titles, but the same exact They have titles, 
[00:06:58] Alexa: like, on the side, but then the front is always, like, a flower of life pattern.
[00:07:01] Sarah (2): Okay. Yeah. I thought 
[00:07:02] Alexa: that was so strange. Like, you can't even, like, suggest what, like, the vibes of this might be. Yeah. Like, it's just like, no, you like, straight read the content. Yeah. Um, 
[00:07:17] Lola: sorry. Thoughts are here. Thoughts are here. We're struggling to get this together. Um, but when you're saying an abundance, or can you have an abundance, A society function.
Wait, say the exact words that you said again so I don't 
[00:07:33] Pierce: Could you, can you have equality with abundance? 
[00:07:36] Lola: With abundance. 
[00:07:38] Pierce: Or maybe, maybe a better question would be with surplus? Because I feel like that was like, because there are types of abundance or whatever, whatever, but like surplus feels like what they're very like adamantly, like both they don't have, but then they're also trying to make sure they don't have it.
[00:07:54] Lola: I don't Yeah, I don't think the two go together. Yeah. Like, I don't think you can have, like, equality of everyone, but then have Circus as something that's, something that's with that, because then you're always going to have, One group that are Yeah, you know, but I also feel like it's a very like it's like a very human conundrums if you look at like You know, like animals like they're not like always needing scarcity to like innovate and move forward and forward and forward They're kind of just like our lions
Whereas for humans we have this like We have some Oh my god, my words. So sorry today everyone. Um, we have abundance and scarcity Which allows us to actually like move forward with things in time, you know And it's just that we've done it to such a high degree that we have all of this Like deep inequalities, you know, which is obviously a lot There Oh my god, i'm so sorry No, no, no, I like that Was 
[00:09:07] Pierce: Yeah, I was thinking about that thing you said about, uh, like a while ago about, um, how, like, all of the early studies on, like, primate behavior was done where they would, like, dump a giant pile of bananas in the middle of the jungle and would, like, bring all the primates together.
And then they were like, oh, they're, like, have all these weird fucked up, like, hierarchies and, like, weird, like, capitalist incentives, you know, whatever, whatever. But then recently when they've redone the same studies by, like, not having the, like, artificial surplus, they're way more equal and, like, they don't have, like, those same types of things.
Yeah. And, you know, so then it's, like, Well, like of course you'd like create this like crazy weird artificial surplus and then now they're acting weird and like capitalistic But 
[00:09:41] Lola: this is have you seen them the rat paradise not the drug one the other rat paradise So they were like, let's give rocks. This isn't the cocaine They were like, let's give rats Everything they could ever want.
Oh 
[00:09:54] Jake: my god, so cute like all the food. Yeah, 
[00:09:57] Lola: all the mates. They're just all the mates And for the first, I can't remember how long, but for the first, like, you know, a quarter of the study, they're like fucking living the vida loca, like having fun with their lives over there. But then they all start getting super fucked up.
Like, the women stops, like, mating with the men, the men stop, like, they started being terrified and, like, not interacting and isolating themselves. 
[00:10:21] Sarah: They 
[00:10:22] Lola: literally couldn't function with abundance or, like, with surplus. Which was like, so interesting. But if you look at like the most, like the people who are at the apex of the world, they all literally become evil.
[00:10:33] Alexa: Do you know what I mean? Yeah. With all of this abundance, like free fucking, free food. Did their population grow out of control, or did they, like, control that? 
[00:10:43] Lola: The population started going out of control, and then they all stopped mating. 
[00:10:46] Alexa: And then they stopped mating. 
[00:10:47] Lola: Yeah. How bad? Because they were just like, not Dude, like, they weren't like Familiar.
Their society was breaking down. What's the 
[00:10:53] Alexa: story of the bee? It's like this weird book that's kind of like propaganda y in a way, but like the, like the, the point about it is that, um Like, whenever there's like, a surplus of food, the population explodes. When the population explodes, um, then people like, want to hurt each other.
Like, there's like this, like, because we like, don't want to like, really, like, we can't share space. It's like, when you put like, a bunch of wolves, like, there's an amount of wolves that you can have in like, a square mileage area before they start eating each other. And there's this, there's something like, about animals that it's like, yeah, we like, we need a, a certain amount of wolves.
It's kind of like, like, tigers and shit too, like, they have like their, like, domain that they can move around. 
[00:11:31] Lola: Yeah. 
[00:11:31] Alexa: Or else they get into fights with one another. So yeah, I was just curious if that's what their pets were 
[00:11:36] Lola: doing. Like fighting with each other? Yeah, but they didn't fight, they were just like I can't remember.
Fighting. Yeah, I think, 
[00:11:41] Pierce: like, cause it didn't, cause the study was meant to be about vulgar populations. Because it was like back in like the 80s and I was really concerned about that so they were like, let's create a similar circumstance that we have and like see what happens when it gets overpopulated but it didn't get to that point where that like really fucked everyone up.
But then it like raised other questions of like if they're like, there's these weird like mammalian psychological tricks, like something that like caused them, like it was overpopulated, but like not in a finite material sort of sense, but in a more tangible like emotional sense or whatever. So then that would have made them all go.
[00:12:15] Jake: This is making me think about how, like, scarcity might be a natural occurrence, and like, it's like natural to not have things, right? But an abundance of, is, to me feels kind of unnatural, like if it's like offsetting it. Yeah. Some sort of like, natural law, or like,
[00:12:40] Sarah: Yeah. 
[00:12:40] Jake: Yeah, I don't know. It feels like a synth, like, an abundance of synthesis in some regard. Like, you can have an orchard, where you have all the fruit that you might need, but that abundance might be limited to like, a person or a family. 
[00:12:55] Sarah: But 
[00:12:55] Jake: then if you have like ten families around an apple tree, then that abundance is no longer an abundance.
You have to figure out how to work together and like share the abundance and like, you know, but if Yeah, I don't know. I just, I feel like an abundance doesn't really happen in nature so much. 
[00:13:12] Lola: An abundance of everything. Anyway, 
[00:13:15] Jake: yeah, 
[00:13:16] Lola: we just ordered a dildo 
[00:13:18] Jake: in five seconds, so it's gonna be shipped here.
Yeah It 
[00:13:22] Sarah (2): does feel like they're natural like Constraints or people put up constraints on abundance like it's like we have abundance in the food now and now people are vegans Vegetarian like it's like there's all these new diets that come out of that like it's a human desire I think to not want abundance like it's over stimulating it 
[00:13:38] Sarah: feels 
[00:13:39] Sarah (2): We like yeah But I feel like there hasn't really been that much, like that check has been big in food.
But like in other consumption, it hasn't really come in as much. Um, 
[00:13:52] Jake: like 
[00:13:52] Sarah: fast fashion. 
[00:13:54] Sarah (2): Yeah, like yeah, fast fashion. Yeah, there's like things, 
[00:13:57] Jake: um. Like cars, like if you go to Texas, everyone has like three cars, four cars. Yeah. Yeah, 
[00:14:04] Sarah (2): a few people are kind of like aesthetic in the way they consume 
[00:14:06] Jake: Yeah, in the middle of summer and there's 70 rooms Every building is air conditioned.
Yeah big massive buildings 
[00:14:19] Yessy: super tangential, but there's another study of rats where they made these little cars and Had them had the rats eat them Like drive and the rats became like happier . 
[00:14:31] Jake: Oh my God. They're like smoking, listening to driving in the little rat cars, . They're like, I just feel free. 
[00:14:40] Yessy: I don't know.
It just like gave them something to do and like felt productive. I don't know. Yeah. Toys. Yeah. But, um, the abundance thing made me think of like, I feel like immigrants, like in their home country, have like scarcity and then, They'll like, immigrate to like, America, for example, and then have this like, new abundance and then like, start hoarding.
[00:15:12] Sarah: Even though 
[00:15:12] Yessy: they don't need to at all, but it's like, they just like, I guess it's like a fear of, Losing everything at any point. 
[00:15:22] Jake: Yeah. Yeah. That's, that ties back into like the, the Adonians that like, didn't want them to come back if he left, but they were like, you're going to be ruined by being around them.
And like, you're an off world or if you come back, like if you go to Eros and you come back from Eros, then you're an Erosti. You're not an Aneresti. 
[00:15:49] Lola: Yeah, 
[00:15:50] Jake: and that was I think that was strangely enough. That was his takeaway to it when he was talking about at the very end. He's talking to the heinous person where he's like, y'all have to come to us.
Like, we can't go to you. Like, y'all have to get here. 
[00:16:06] Sarah: And 
[00:16:06] Jake: then you can meet us. Like, if we come to you, we all die. Like, our It's almost like there's a virus or something. Which is funny, because that's how the book starts. Yeah, like, knowing that abundance, in a way, does feel like some sort of sickness. That you have to, like He literally had to be, like, inoculated against.
In some regard. 
[00:16:29] Lola: I feel like it does a really good job at, like, showing that, you know, in each society, like, neither, like, neither works because they're both, like, not aligned with, like, the laws of nature. You know, like, it's like humans have created these worlds for ourselves and, like, tried to make it fit with how we think a society should function.
Neither of them are just how we do function as, like, natural creatures, you know? 
[00:16:57] Jake: Yeah, I started feeling like systems are inherently anti human. 
[00:17:02] Sarah: Yeah, literally. 
[00:17:02] Jake: Like, any system that you could come up with, like the individuals, are always going to break it. Like, with the, the lovers. And it's also evidenced by his relationship with his mom.
You know, like, you find, like, when they first meet, it's cold and weird and, but the mom is like, I just, in case you wanted to, I'm here and You know, he's like, well, if you didn't care, I don't care. Fuck you. I don't know you. You're just a woman, you know, my sister. And then, like, near the end of the book, you learn from, uh, Takvar that he, like, was really fucked up by the, uh, The fact that he didn't have his mother and he, like, really wanted her.
And so you realize in that moment that he was, like, He was going against his own nature by, like, rejecting her. You know, and I also think it's evidenced by his love with Thakbar. That, like, the system, like, rips them apart, but, like, they're They're like, no, we're, like, we're, we're, we're this, we're together, you know?
So it's like even the, even in like an optimal, or like a more optimal system than what URAS has, there's still like cracks in it that are coming through from their human nature, and like, Even inside of the individual, he's like, fighting against that, 
[00:18:24] Sarah: too. 
[00:18:27] Lola: Yeah. Like, I don't know what your guys biggest, like, question for yourselves were from reading it, but Like, even I was like, talking to like, Harry, who's living with us, and I was like, like, what is Like, what What do you think is the way to incentivize a system For you guys?
To be able to, like, do, like, produce and, like, have art and, like, have individuality and be allowed to own things, but then also not to have this, like, total, just, like, I don't know what the words are, the opposite of that over here, where, you know, like, identity just becomes ego and status and separation and, you know, the few at the top get everything for it.
Everyone else having nothing like we were like genuinely trying to think of like, how do you fix that? You know, it's like I'm, i'm just curious if you guys had any 
[00:19:27] Pierce: I don't think 
[00:19:28] Lola: you 
[00:19:28] Pierce: can fix it And I think I one of the things I really liked about the book was like his struggling with his society's own flaws, and like, how he kept coming back to like, you know, like the, like, um, Anaris, like, um, like, our political system is a process, or, you know, like it's a process of constant revolution, um, and it's like a process of constant, like, reinvention, because any time, any time it like, slows down to become a system, then it doesn't work.
It only works in this constantly re evaluating and moving thing. Um, and I feel like that is a, to me feels like a very, the closest I've ever heard to a solid answer, but also very difficult and unhelpful because it's like, how do you like, you know, you're, you're basically just being like, I don't know, the only constant is change, and like as an answer for like, what's the constant you want?
And like, that's not, you know, in a tangible sense, that's not super helpful, but it does feel right. Yeah. 
[00:20:24] Sarah: Yeah, 
[00:20:26] Jake: I feel like she left me with the same feeling of like it's 
[00:20:30] Sarah: not, 
[00:20:30] Jake: like any system is going to imprison the soul. And there's like some way, there's like some reality that we all have inside of us that's going to be broken as part of that system.
Like the, the The proprietarians have like their tits out and their feelings are like outward. They're so outward to the point where they're like conniving on the outward emotions that they're showing. They're like showing false outward emotions so they can do their other things and the, uh, the moon people are like completely devoid of really showing any of their emotions because it's for the best of the like community.
Like when talk to her gets sent away because Again, with the mother. She says, uh,
When Thakur says about it, she says,
She only knows denial. Like, 
[00:21:40] Jake: they deny their feelings there. And, Oh, here it is, um, 364 in this version. Tocqueville says, She left when he was two, about his mother. The father stayed with him. Nothing unusual, of course, except chefs. He feels that he lost something essential. He and the father both. I feel like that feeling of losing something essential, it's like that essential nature I think is You're gonna lose part of that essence when you extend beyond yourself.
If you're like a part of any system, at least that was the That was what I took away from it. It's like, less how do we create a system where we're not going to lose something, but because we have both of these things inside of us, one system is necessarily going to be removing, in any dualistic way. Yeah.
Like, 
if we contain both inside of us, any 
system based on either of those is gonna like, mean that part of us has to be separate, 
[00:22:42] Lola: right? I thought that was like, something that was interesting with both of the systems is that they both function on separation. It's just that like, in, I'm gonna say it wrong, URIs, URIs, I'm dyslexic, can't remember how to say it.
The one, the URIs, URIs. Earth and Moon? URIs. Yeah, you can say URIs. They, like, they are separated from, um, I'm going to say the other one wrong now as well. Aries. Why can't I say them? An Aries. An Aries. An Aries. Your Aries. Your Aries. Um, sorry, but like, they're, their society functions on this, like, basis that they're better because they're separate from them.
And then over here, they have an internal separation where they're like, they're separate from you. But it's like, no matter what, they were deriving value in their societies from being separate. That's very interesting. 
[00:23:39] Sarah: That's very true. Yeah, 
[00:23:42] Alexa: cause they still had this, they were able to like, unify under this idea that they were, It's a little better than the other ones.
Yeah. Yeah, not so equal, huh? Very interesting. Wait, um, I have to interrupt this broadcast to tell you that I made a wacket. 
[00:23:58] Sarah: Oh my god. 
[00:24:00] Alexa: There's a little pussy, there's a dick, there's a little tits on the side, here's the balls, and then on the back is gonna be the little asshole. Oh my 
[00:24:07] Sarah: gosh. Oh my 
[00:24:09] Lola: gosh. Wow that's amazing!
It's so detailed. Do you pass 
[00:24:16] Sarah: it around? I pass it around. Wait, 
[00:24:21] Alexa: what's a Wacky? It's a, um. Oh, 
[00:24:27] Yessy: okay. That's what I thought. Yeah. 
[00:24:29] Alexa: I, I think you are an artiste. It's a lick it, suck it, fuck it. Yeah. Bop it. 
[00:24:35] Jake: They use it to like, to help a kid figure out what their sexuality is. Like based off On the Wacket. You're like, I like dicks and tits.
[00:24:50] Sarah: Wait. I was 
[00:24:53] Yessy: like, does this have to do with Will? It does. That's where the name came from. I don't know what we were, we were just 
[00:25:01] Jake: like ripping on his name and then the object came into being as we started developing products based off of Will's name. 
[00:25:10] Sarah (2): Product design. Yeah, 
[00:25:13] Sarah: it's beautiful. 
[00:25:16] Jake: Yeah, the dividing lines.
That brings the wall metaphor into stark contrast for me, because it like ends with the wall. It starts with the wall. Yeah. Anytime somebody in the book says wall, I'm just like, Ooh, they said it, you know, they said wall. Um, 
[00:25:33] Sarah (2): I mean, wall is like, Well, I feel like wall reverts back to like binary, like it's like you're like differentiating two things, zero and one.
Like, it's like, it's how the, it's how computers think. It's how the human brain, like, it's like we've reduced everything down in our world. It's, it is the one or zero. And that's like, the wall is giving. The have and the have not. I was trying to visualize 
[00:25:57] Yessy: like what the wall looked like. Like how it separates whatever from whatever.
But I couldn't. Because somebody had like It was hard to see 
[00:26:08] Jake: that. Yeah. 
[00:26:10] Yessy: Yeah. 
[00:26:12] Jake: Yeah. It's the first paragraph. There was a wall. It did not look important. It was built of uncut rocks, roughly mortared. An adult could look right over it, and even a child could climb it. Where it crossed the roadway, instead of having a gate, it degenerated into mere geometry, a line, the idea of a boundary.
But the idea was real. It was important. For seven generations, there had been nothing in the world more important than that wall. Like all walls, it was ambiguous, two faced. 
[00:26:40] Sarah: What was 
[00:26:40] Jake: inside it, what was outside it, depended on, upon which side of it you were on. Looked at from one side, the wall enclosed a barren, 60 acre field.
On the, on the field, We're a couple of large gantry cranes, a rocket pad, three warehouses, a truck, and a dorm. Yeah, like, oh, this was my, one of my favorite parts. Looked out from the other side, the wall enclosed the Nares. The whole planet was inside it. A great prison camp cut off from other worlds and other men in quarantine.
The whole universe was imprisoned on the other side. Yeah, it's like, the mere idea of it is somehow more important than like, the physicality of the wall. Like, going back to like the notion of like, separation. As like the dividing line between everybody, like how can you, how can you really be an equal people if you have that division inside of you?
Which makes me wonder could we ever, could the Odonians really ever be truly equal? 
[00:27:49] Pierce: Well, and is that even worthwhile? Like, I remember, like, years ago when I was, like, living in England and really, like, wanted to stay there and just had all this, like, legal trouble with, like, borders and it was so, like, anti country and all this stuff and it was like, why does anyone believe in all of this?
And I tried to, like, as a thought experiment, Okay, I don't care about countries, but like, what do I care about? And it got to the point where I was like, well, I very much care that like my family is my family. And that other people can't just be like, I'm part of your family. Like I'm kicking your dad out.
Like, I'm like, I'm glad that there is that border. 
[00:28:20] Sarah: That's so interesting. That'd be horrible.
Yeah. 
[00:28:27] Pierce: Um, and it feels like that, that feels like a very, like, universally, like, yeah, we're all pretty, pretty okay with that as a boundary. But then, beyond that, I feel like it starts, you know, but then the fact that I'm okay with that boundary makes me have a lot harder of a time, like, condemning boundaries point blank.
[00:28:43] Sarah (2): Yeah. 
[00:28:44] Alexa: Because there probably are societies where people are like, Like, all the families are really close to each other, So like, you just like stay at anyone's house, whatever. Yeah. It's more like a village type of thing. 
[00:28:53] Sarah (2): Yeah. 
[00:28:54] Alexa: So you're not like, Oh, I guess you're kind of like my dad too, Because we're always hanging out.
[00:28:58] Pierce: Yeah. I feel like, For, for me, uh, part of an answer for that is like it's less about like is there boundaries or is there not and it's more about like how do you hold those boundaries within your heart where it's like, you know, like sure I'm glad that other people can't just like be my dad, but I also want to live a life where I extend the same type of like grace and love and compassion towards people who aren't in my family as are.
You know, it's like why, like why do you have the boundaries, not do you have them or do you not? Hmm.
[00:29:30] Jake: Is all boundary, does all boundary imply ownership? 
[00:29:34] Sarah (2): Hmm.
I think, I think unless you're like on the cusp of the boundary, yeah. Or you have people who are like you, versus people that are not. And like within the own individual, there's this like, me versus not me. That comes out of that. 
[00:29:53] Alexa: I feel like sometimes it's not ownership, but like stewardship. Like sometimes it's ownership.
It's about, like, caring for something. Or like, uh, like, maybe you don't necessarily own a garden, but you, like, protect it from other things eating it so that it can, like, flourish. 
[00:30:06] Sarah: You 
[00:30:07] Alexa: know? It's not necessarily like, it's mine. Like, maybe I want to grow this stuff for other people. I 
[00:30:12] Jake: think Shevik would agree with that, but I don't think the Odonians did.
Because they were like, don't go. Nobody can come in. If you leave, you can't come back. Like, this is ours. This boundary is, like, collectively ours.
But I think that was maybe the point that was made at the end of the novel, with like, the heinous person, like, wanting to come back, and Shevik also being like, I don't know if they're gonna shoot us, man. Like, they might just gun us down when we get there. You know? 
[00:30:45] Alexa: I like that their, like, theory was called the social organism.
Because I think that the body is a really good metaphor for it. Because, like, if your cells didn't have membranes, they wouldn't be able to function. You know? So I think that there is, like, There are lines drawn around things to the degree that it lost its function.
And like, they all function as like, organs in the organism, like all the industries or whatever. Did she use cells as a I looked that a lot. I think she did. Somewhere. 
[00:31:12] Jake: Somewhere in here there was 
[00:31:14] Alexa: There was cell talk somewhere. Cell talk. 
[00:31:18] Jake: Cause that's really, that's, I really like that line of thinking because it, it gets back to the like impossibility of like a perfect, in the context of like ownership and non ownership, like we can't ever have fully either of those things, you know, like no system is going to be perfect when our cells have walls, you know, if we're primordial goo, then like, You know, that's one thing.
If we're in the soup. Then 
[00:31:48] Alexa: whatever goes. 
[00:31:48] Jake: Yeah. 
[00:31:49] Alexa: Yeah. 
[00:31:50] Lola: And 
[00:31:55] Pierce: even primordial goo. Presumably there's an edge to said goo. That experience is different than being in the middle of the goo. In the middle of whatever. Didn't 
[00:32:04] Jake: she mention the DAO in here somewhere? 
[00:32:09] Alexa: Something like the DAO. There was, uh It had another name or something.
I 
don't know where to find it. There should be nowhere to look.
[00:32:26] Jake: I really loved their relationship to shit. It's not really amusing. 
What was it again? 
[00:32:35] Jake: Like, uh, all of the propertarians were like, ashamed of their shit. You know? They were like, hide it away, and they like, made the rooms all beautiful, and like, golden toilets, and there's like a throne, and like a church, and you know, the moon people were just like, ah, whatever, it's just shit.
This is our shit. 
[00:32:53] Sarah: Like, 
[00:32:55] Jake: people that work with the shit, and then, you know. 
[00:32:58] Alexa: Yeah. No shame in being a shit 
[00:33:00] Jake: shelter. Didn't give a shit about it. 
[00:33:02] Sarah (2): Visually, it would be, I would like, um, I mean, I don't know, there are, there are movies about this, right? We might see the I don't know. Yaki one. Anyway, I would like to just like see, like, See how people look, like, how they express themselves, um, in Moon, because I 
[00:33:18] Alexa: was curious about that too, cause like, they're all wearing just like their plain, like, suit.
Yeah. And they, they all are like, they've all value being, like, a worker. Yeah. 
[00:33:29] Sarah (2): And 
[00:33:29] Alexa: that's like a very particular, like, way of being, like a, I'm stepping up to do the job. Yeah. Like kind of masculine in a way, maybe. 
[00:33:35] Sarah (2): Yeah. And I even like how people talk. I feel like everyone's voice is so different and people's mannerisms, their bodies, whatever.
And like, that's such an individual, even beyond clothes or like things that you actually do, like people look inherently different. Height is, you know, like there's all these things. Um, yeah. 
[00:33:53] Alexa: He, like, noticed one girl at his, like, going away party, and it was because she had, like, a haircut and a crumb on her lip.
Yeah, 
[00:34:01] Sarah (2): yeah, yeah, a crumb on her lip! Nice jewelry. 
[00:34:06] Jake: Oh, true individuality, yeah. Forget a belly button ring, she had a crumb.
You were wearing the shit out of that 
[00:34:17] Sarah (2): crumb. It's funny how the individual, like, The lack of individuality, how they decide names, you know, where it's like this computer generated thing. Each person has like their own individual one. There's an effort to that. It's like, that almost feels more individual, like close to individuality than like our system where, yeah, they're like a lot of people have the name Jake or what like, and it's such like a weird, like grouping of identity.
And it's so random. You don't know all the other Jake's out there. It's such like, uh, um, yeah, names. It made me really think about names and how like kind of unnatural it is. It's really strange. 
[00:34:55] Alexa: Because then I bet, often people like, you maybe like, stay away from people who have your name. 
[00:35:00] Sarah (2): Totally, you do.
Because it's like, competitive. It's so competitive. 
[00:35:03] Yessy: Really? My government is Jessica. 
[00:35:06] Sarah (2): Oh my god. Yeah. Yeah, that would be. I was like, 
[00:35:10] Lola: oh, that so many Lolas, it's not an uncommon name. But to me, I'm the only Lola in the world. 
[00:35:20] Sarah (2): Seriously. Yeah. Same with Sarah. Imagine that. Imagine that. Delusion that is going on.
[00:35:29] Alexa: I can't be near one of those goddamn things. Exactly. It keeps me away. I know, thank God. Yeah, when people have them in their homes, I'm like, I'll give them away. 
[00:35:36] Jake: That's really good. It does trigger your innate sense of ownership if someone shares your name. Yeah. It's like a safeguard against the abundance of names.
But it's also 
[00:35:46] Lola: your experience in life where you're like, Whoa, that person has experience. Yeah. 
[00:35:53] Sarah: Same spell. 
[00:35:54] Lola: Like, there's even, like, studies that show that your face, as you, like, grow up, changes based on your name. Like, you, like, grow I saw that one, yeah. Your facial features will grow into, like, the name that you What?
Yeah. Like, really crazy shit. Wait, what are the examples? We don't know 
[00:36:08] Alexa: why, 
[00:36:08] Lola: but I, I can't remember. What does a chuck look 
[00:36:10] Alexa: like? They showed people, like, all these faces, and they gave them, like, a multiple choice test of what you think that person's name is, and more often than not, people, like, Okay.
[00:36:19] Sarah (2): Controlling for, like, all day. Yeah, yeah, yeah, totally. 
[00:36:24] Alexa: Race and, 
[00:36:25] Sarah (2): okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, probably 
[00:36:26] Alexa: that. Yeah. Probably 
[00:36:27] Sarah (2): that. I would hope. 
[00:36:28] Alexa: That's not a thing. Yeah. Yeah. Cause, 
[00:36:34] Lola: yeah, I feel like there's, there's an ownership of more than your name. It's, it's like your literal, like, life. Yeah. When people have your, your name, you know?
Like, not that I'm sitting there thinking that, 
[00:36:44] Jake: but 
[00:36:45] Lola: if I go deeper into it. Yeah. 
[00:36:47] Jake: This, this one, this kind of ties back to where I wrote Dao in my book. And also the reference of the social organism. Uh, to make a thief, make an owner. To create crime, create laws.
Yeah, like, that notion is, ties back to the name where it's like, to create. Ownership and one's own self, like, let people share names, feels like in the same vein there. Like, there's, there's, it almost feels like the Ojodeans are trying to, like, protect humans from certain natural inclinations that would have them, like, they're like proprietarian inclinations, maybe.
Yeah. 
[00:37:27] Alexa: Oh yeah, so then nobody has to deal with that feeling of ownership over their name. Yeah. Exactly. 
[00:37:31] Jake: Because 
[00:37:33] Alexa: everyone has their own. It's like, 
[00:37:34] Jake: to create a proprietary and let them have, let them share names. Which is funny because it would be sharing and more communal if, but there's like something there that disallows that.
Like you would think, I would think that the proprietarians would have unique names. 
[00:37:49] Alexa: Uh 
[00:37:49] Jake: huh. Yeah. You know, but. 
[00:37:52] Alexa: But it's more about like the community. Yeah. Like, it's not a hard surface law, it's like a generational sphere. It's 
[00:37:57] Jake: a human thing, yeah. It's like the unshakable thing. 
[00:38:01] Sarah (2): Yeah, I'd like to see a study where it looks at the diversity of names within a culture and how communitarian or proprietarian they are.
I'm sure you could do that easily. And that might be a relationship. Hello, girl! 
[00:38:16] Will: Let me interrupt your proprietarian discussion. Oh my god, you guys! This is a discussion. Coffee. Yeah, a discussion we are currently in. Wait, I've always wanted to try this. Is that the 
[00:38:34] Yessy: sushi? Yeah. From Edith's? 
[00:38:37] Will: It's from a place right over here.
Tastes like coffee. Oh. I've never had one. It's good. 
[00:38:45] Alexa: Oh! I made a wagon. Oh 
[00:38:48] Sarah: my god. 
[00:38:49] Alexa: Look at that. It's amazing. 
[00:38:53] Jake (2): What's he 
[00:38:53] Will: gonna go for? Oh! We're just gonna go, shh. We had so fun. Yep, we should definitely make another play doh. Yeah. Is the tit opposite the dick? 
[00:39:06] Jake (2): It would be nice to suck on a tit. Wow. At the same time.
Yeah, how can we make this reach around? Oh, maybe it could be 
[00:39:15] Lola: modular. 
[00:39:16] Jake (2): Oh, that would be so cool. Yeah. 
[00:39:22] Lola: We have to. Yeah, I think our country needs 
[00:39:24] Jake: it. 
[00:39:26] Lola: We're really 
[00:39:27] Jake: going to push kickstarters, like, uh, terms of agreement. 
[00:39:31] Lola: Oh my god, no, this is a done deal. Like, this is, think of the amount of rich 20 year olds there are.
That would just, I don't 
[00:39:37] Sarah: know. There's so many 
[00:39:38] Will: rich 20 year olds. There's 
[00:39:40] Sarah: so 
[00:39:40] Lola: many rich 20 year 
[00:39:41] Jake: olds. That's all we spend money on. 
[00:39:43] Sarah: The 
[00:39:44] Jake: principle that you, uh, give to the non sexual, poly queer 
[00:39:48] Sarah: ones. Yeah. Prove it. 
[00:39:53] Jake (2): That's what it 
[00:39:56] Sarah: might be. 
[00:39:58] Lola: Prove it. Got 
[00:40:04] Will: your little zens? Got my little zens. I mean, look. I was Refreshing myself during rehearsal.
[00:40:13] Jake: So we opened up the space. Pierce had asked a question about the relationship between scarcity and equality. And like, can equality exist alongside abundance? And the nature of the relationship. So we've kind of gone in a couple different directions from there. We've talked about names and like the uniqueness of, uh, the quality of life for the Anirusti people.
And we also started talking a bit about, um, like the Tao and like the creation of certain, like maybe innate human impulses. that the anorexia people seem to try to like curtail and nip in the bud to like disallow them from like Having these emerging properties of being a proprietarian Like not letting you have a mom or dad and like everyone's your brother and sister and they separate you at birth And it doesn't really matter if you're my sister and we actually end up getting married or have sex with each other Like I guess they didn't really care about that one Um, you know, so like they're it seems like they're They're kind of putting these restrictions on the anorexia to prevent them from like being tainted by some innate proprietary 
[00:41:30] Will: impulses that we might 
[00:41:31] Jake: have.
[00:41:31] Will: And it's almost a more sinister way of enforcing it by saying that like, this is just our culture because they don't believe in like having a government to enforce that type of things when it feels like it's coming from yourself. You know, it's like you're almost mistaken for Just like the way life is 
[00:41:50] Sarah: Which 
[00:41:50] Will: feels almost more dangerous than like when you can identify that something's externally placed on you You can at least like investigate it differentiate from yourself.
Yeah, but like it's hard to interrogate it when you're just like Oh, well, I don't believe in possession. I don't believe in family . These are things that are just the way 
[00:42:07] Pierce: life is true. And I feel like at at the end, he was kind of like failing against that a little bit when he was like saying there's like one line where it was like, like a true doesn't like has no master including himself.
And I thought like, I've been thinking about that like a lot. Like where like, because I feel like that that was like taking. I don't know, things that step further even than I thought possible. Like, I don't know, how do we, like, not even let our own mental faculties, our own thought processes control us?
Well, 
[00:42:38] Sarah (2): it makes me think of the, um, the quote from the lecture we went to, where he's, uh, the one about the moon, where it's like, in order to see the moon, You have to get rid of yourself. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I couldn't see it because I was too bright. I was too bright, yeah. 
[00:42:52] Pierce: Uh, it was at that thing at Pioneer.
Pioneer O'Connor. Pioneer O'Connor, yeah. I'll find it, yeah. 
[00:43:00] Sarah (2): It was gorgeous. But the self is so in the way. So many things. 
[00:43:07] Jake: This kind of reminds me of The Wall, too. I'm like thinking about freedom, like what is true freedom. And like, on the one hand, true freedom is like we don't put Tyrion in the insane asylum for writing some art.
And like, the proprietarians had the freedom to like choose whatever they wanted to do, wherever they wanted to live, whoever they wanted to fuck, like, you know, whoever they wanted to marry. And the Odonians, like, couldn't do that. Like If you wanted to be partnered with someone, you might just be split, and you would have to like, accept that you, like what Pierce was saying, your ma like, true freedom is not having a master, even your own self is not your own master.
And the Shevik would agree that like, that's real freedom. But, they're locked into this thing, so, coming back to the wall, it's like the perspective of whatever side of the wall you're on determines what you see, you know? And I think we can both agree that like, there are parts of us, the dualistic, our dualistic nature allows us to see the real freedom of having like, no masters, but we also see the chains there, and then looking from the Rusty standpoint, we can see the freedom of like being able to pursue art, you know, like, maybe we'll be poor doing it, but like we can still do it and not go to the loony bin and be like, rejected from society, but then we also obviously.
So you see the chains involved in that as well, which to me is kind of, kind of freaks me out a little 
[00:44:37] Sarah: bit 
[00:44:38] Jake: if like, uh, Pascal, Pascal said, like, the only thing that makes patricide like wrong is like the side of the river that you're standing on, just like referring to the fact that like the culture kind of dictate, whatever your culture is, dictates what you Could be like right or wrong, and I'm, I'm like having trouble getting away from that now, thinking about this.
It's like, is there, is there really a concept of this freedom? Yeah. As long as we have walls and boundaries which seem necessary. 
[00:45:11] Sarah (2): Yeah. 
[00:45:12] Pierce: Something my sister has talked a lot about that I really like is the difference between freedom from and freedom to. And I don't know if this is necessarily an issue.
Like, comparing like, European ideas of freedom with American. Because America is so much freedom from, but so little freedom to. And, uh, you know, where it's like, we don't have freedom, like, you know, we have freedom from taxes or the government or whatever, but we don't have freedom to like, move where we want to, or go to school, uh, or like, get sick.
Yeah, for sure. Or 
even, like, yesterday, like, I was, I had anxiety about, like, having wine and candles in the car. Because, like, cops, like, cops. 
[00:45:43] Pierce: And I don't 
even know what the point of those guys are. It's like, 
[00:45:46] Sarah (2): yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. 
[00:45:49] Jake (2): You're gonna go to jail. Like, surprise, surprise. 
[00:45:52] Pierce: Jail. Hell. Exactly. And I think like, along, along those lines I feel like, like true freedom might not be possible or even what we want to, you know like, but like thinking through what, what do we want from freedom and then like running in that path as much as possible.
[00:46:16] Jake: Freedom from and freedom to is like still framing that from a perspective, right? If you like, put it, like, make it local, you're like freedom 
[00:46:25] Will: from or, yeah. Totally. There's still like a position which you're viewing something from. Yeah. I thought that like the first 10 pages for me were like so Like the writing itself, like the form was capturing the meaning in such a beautiful way.
Um, and kind of like along these lines of like, boundaries and like containment, like things within and things without. I mean they were talking about the like, I think it's the PDC, uh, like that like place on Anaraski. The closest thing to the government they have. Okay, what was like the area where like the ship lands?
Yes. On the pin? Yeah, just the wall. You know what I'm talking about? Yeah. 48. And they have like a little wall around it, but they, the wall's not actually a barrier. It's just like a symbolic boundary. And the like language that she uses is like really stunning here, where she basically like. Starts to say, like, words that I think are, like, really interesting.
So she, she says, like, On page, what is this? Eight? Nine? 
[00:47:32] Sarah (2): Sounds like gum. 
[00:47:33] Will: Like, for hours or days, he's just in a vacancy. Yeah, Brian, I couldn't go, like, without him. The walls could say about him, outside them was the silence. His arms had ended atoxic arcs from injections. Hearing a fever that never quite had delirium.
But left him in a limbo between reason and unreason. No man's land, time did not pass. There was no time, he was time. He only, he was the river, the arrow, the arrow. I think they were thrown rock hung still at midpoint So she really with the language here is driving exactly that point of like here and there Inside and outside within and without like before and after like all of those dualities of the world And then I thought it was so interesting That the one place that's actually between, that's not necessarily in both, is the ship between the two planets and it's called the Mindful.
And I thought, and like there's a kind of like limbo in, in that ship for Shebek when he's traveling to and from. And I thought that was, and that's when he like for the first time actually sees his planet for what it is. This, you know, jewel in the sky. I thought that was just a really powerful symbolism kind of of that where it's like, There are all these dualities and extremes and maybe the only way to, like, not be, like, under the control of one or, like, to truly, like, you know, be the master of all, like, the master of yourself or whatever it is, is to occupy the space between.
[00:49:02] Sarah (2): Yeah, or outside 
[00:49:03] Will: of. Or outside of. I know, but the prepositions are impossible, like, they're all, they all chip you up. Which I think goes to show like that our like language like the way that we like view the world it is from a place of like possession and and like extremity like of being rather than we're like of Like, existing in one or the other, rather than just being, and like, the potential that you could occupy both at the same time.
[00:49:30] Alexa: I have this book that, I don't, I don't think it really makes sense necessarily as like a, we'll read this as an egg, but it's a cool resource, it's called Metaphors We Live By, and each chapter is about like, a way that we talk about something, like for example, uh, like we spend time, like we don't like, Yeah, yeah.
Wow, you're spending time 
[00:49:51] Will: together. Rather than like having time together. 
[00:49:54] Sarah (2): Or take a break. Like it's like, you know, like, Yeah, yeah, you're like, yeah. You don't deserve it, or yeah, you Yeah, so 
[00:50:02] Will: like having a break. Or being in a break. Yeah. Taking it. Whoa. 
[00:50:07] Sarah (2): That sounds like really cool. 
[00:50:09] Alexa: Yeah, I'll take a picture of it.
I'll send it to you. Yeah, that sounds 
[00:50:11] Pierce: fascinating. In the early 2000s, the London Police Department had like all this like issues with police brutality. And then there was like sub forces in America. But they were like, we need to stop this. So they changed, all they did was they changed the name from the London Police Force to the London Police Service.
And it drastically cut down. Yeah. I 
[00:50:30] Alexa: love that. That's amazing. 
[00:50:31] Pierce: They changed the word. From force to service. Yeah. And I feel like, so London changed the name of their police from the London Police Force to the London Police Service and it decreased incidences of police brutality. Wow. Or when Sam 
[00:50:45] Alexa: felt like, um, when they did the study with like, putting judges in soft chairs rather than like a hard bench and their sentences were less Oh.
Oh my god. How fucking crazy is that? Like 
[00:50:57] Will: Yeah, it goes to show you that everything really is just perspective. Even things that we think are like hard coded thoughts. 
[00:51:02] Alexa: Well, we think that we're like, like pure, rational, like conscious beings, but we're like actually body creatures. So like, we're like, we're always, we're always like 
[00:51:10] Sarah: this.
[00:51:11] Alexa: Yeah. And like what comes into our senses, like the sounds of things, like how the forest sounds or the service sounds. Mm hmm.
[00:51:23] Lola: Um, I want to just, to your point about living in the in between, what would you mock the ship to not in that? Do you know what I mean? Like that's what is living in that space in between. What 
[00:51:38] Will: is the mindful? Yeah. I think it's mindfulness. 
[00:51:42] Sarah (2): Would you say it's biking between locations? It's biking. That's a close approximation too.
Actually, yes. It actually is as close as I'm going 
[00:51:48] Will: to get. Because you're incredibly 
[00:51:50] Sarah (2): present. Yeah. 
[00:51:50] Will: It's like Apollonian and Dionysian. It's like, you're existing in neither. 
[00:51:56] Sarah (2): And you're not obligated of like, doing anything in that moment except moving through. It's been like, that's the only thing you're doing.
It's not, yeah. 
[00:52:02] Will: That's a good question, like, where do we see ourselves? 
[00:52:05] Lola: Yeah. Being truly present 
[00:52:07] Will: and not present. Being, like, exerted upon from other forces. 
[00:52:11] Lola: Yeah, what is that place? Cause you're also, like, you know, when he's in the ship going over, like, he's separated from, like, reality, whether that's on moon or earth.
You're, you're pulled out, and not actually like, embodying 
[00:52:27] Will: the culture or the, or the media. Totally, and he doesn't really have agency 
[00:52:30] Lola: there either. Yeah. 
[00:52:31] Will: Like it's not, like he's kind of like in a room, that he doesn't escape. Yeah. Right? Like he's just in this holding 
[00:52:37] Jake: area. Yeah, I think that, I think that mindful is the ability to see both at the same time, because you can see both places.
See both planets. And, uh, on 355 in this one, near the end of the last paragraph of chapter 10, it also ties in cell. Uh, I'll start a little bit before that. For after all he thought now, lying in the warmth of Tochter's sleep. It was joy they were both after. The completeness of being. If you evade suffering, you also evade the chance of joy.
Pleasure you may get, or pleasures, but you will not be fulfilled. You will not know what it is to come home. Talked for a side softly in its sleep, as if agreeing with him and turned over, pushing some quiet dream, pursuing some quiet dream. Fulfillment, Shevik thought, is a function of time. The search for pleasure is search of it.
Repetitive. Atemporal. The variety seeking of the spectator, the thrill hunter, the sexually promiscuous always ends in the same place. It has an end. It comes to the end and has a start over. Has to start over. It is not a journey and a return, but a closed cycle. A locked room. A cell.
Like, knowing that we're in this cycle, It's like a cycle of like, going and coming, to and from, like, leave and return, come back to home, whether it's like a propertarian thing, or, you know, like whether we're going to the moon or we're going to Uras, like. I feel like we have, to be complete is to have the fullness of the mindful, you know, the liminal space, or like the space from which you can see both of those things.
Yeah. Because it's a cell, like the, like we live in a cell, like literally, cells are inside of us, you know, a locked room, like we are a locked room kind of in a sense. We are, we are a cycle.
[00:54:38] Lola: So from being in a position where you can see both, do you think it is to actually just like live life without being integrated into those cultures? Like the way you're saying that like depending on one, what side of a river you're on or what side of a wall you're on, your values or your perspectives are completely different.
Like if you're living from the space between, is it to like actually just not engage? I 
[00:55:02] Pierce: feel 
[00:55:02] Lola: like that's the Buddhist approach, but I 
[00:55:03] Pierce: wouldn't say. My controversial answer would be it's to engage wholeheartedly.
With the, you know, it's like you don't know, you don't know like, you can't experience the joy of coming home if you don't leave. And it's like you have to, you have to like fully engage. Yeah, 
[00:55:26] Jake: we can, I'll show, I'll just continue reading from there. Outside the locked room is a landscape of time, in which the spirit may, with luck and courage, construct the fragile, makeshift, improbable roads and cities of fidelity, a landscape inhabitable by human beings.
Whoa, that's hitting different. A landscape inhabitable by human beings. Like these worlds that we create. It is not until an act occurs within the landscape of the past and the future that that act is a human act. Loyalty, which asserts the continuity of past and future, binding time into whole, is the root of human strength.
There is no good to be done without it. 
[00:56:08] Alexa: Love that. 
[00:56:09] Jake: Yeah, I, I guess I'll just leave it there. 
[00:56:14] Sarah (2): Yeah. 
[00:56:15] Alexa: Wait, 
[00:56:15] Sarah (2): what page was that, Jake? 
[00:56:17] Jake: Same, uh, very last, uh, very last, um, paragraph, chapter 10. 
[00:56:22] Alexa: That reminds me of, um, Wesley's beautiful phrase, Objective narrative coherence. Because, like, you do, you do things because they make sense in your story.
Like, there, there is an origin point to this action. Like, it's in service to, like, this story. This future that you want to build. It's like, you're, you're rooted in time. When you're acting. 
[00:56:41] Sarah: Um, 
[00:56:42] Alexa: I think you need to do a whole heartedly for it to like, really be worth it, part of the story. 
[00:56:48] Jake: Yeah, totally. In the same area, there was probably Process, process was all.
You could go in a promising direction or you could go wrong, but you did not set out with the expectation of ever stopping anywhere. All responsibilities, I think that's what's directly what's happening. All responsibilities, all commitments, thus understood, took on substance and duration. So his mutual commitment with Tocqueville, their relationship had remained thoroughly alive during the four year separation.
They had both suffered from it, and suffered a good deal. And here's the part. But it had not occurred to either of them to escape the suffering by denying the truth. So I think that, I think that is the answer for them at least. They're not abstaining from the reality of like, this isn't a story where they run away from their systems because like, love is the best thing that you could have in the world, and they should just be together.
You know, they stayed in the system, and they realize that the process is everything that they actually have, or that we actually have. And that suffering is part of it. Just 
[00:57:54] Sarah: enjoy this. 
[00:57:58] Sarah (2): I like that I mean that the very last line of that chapter is like talking about uh, it's time that it says like the thing about working through time working with time instead of against it he thought is that it is not wasted even pain counts and like there's this idea that like pain pain you want to rush through get past it get past it but if you you know that's that's what it is that's it's yeah you value it then 
[00:58:23] Jake: Sorry, I'm getting excited, but this comes back to the abundance conversation.
Right? Because, like, an abundance of love is an absence of something else. If we're actually looking at this from a perspective, like, an abundance would be a wall, right? Like, what are you losing whenever you gain something? Like, I always come back to that question, personally, and it's like, if we have all the food in the world, what are we losing?
Like, what did those rats lose when they had an abundance of, or what did the monkeys lose when they had an abundance of bananas? 
[00:58:56] Sarah: You know, like, they lost the 
[00:58:57] Jake: need to, like, figure out social hierarchies and orders, or whatever it was, you know. But, like, we lose something when we have that, and that's us working against, like, abundance, to me, feels like.
A manner of working against 
[00:59:13] Sarah (2): time. We're trying to rush time. We're trying to, yeah. 
[00:59:17] Pierce: Because I was thinking, like, with, like, abundance in nature, there are specific points of abundance, but, like, they're natural because they're finite, like, very finite. Where it's like, when the salmon are running, the bears are like, this is sick, and they eat a little.
Like, because of that, over hundreds of years, they've evolved to need that, and that moment is part of this. Like, you know, they're not going to, like, fight that. When they're here, I'm going to eat a lot and then I'm going to be really sneaky and survive the winter. Like, you know, like, yeah. Like the stock 
[00:59:42] Jake: market, the salmon 
[00:59:43] Pierce: just 
[00:59:43] Jake: don't keep getting more and more.
Yeah, yeah. 
[00:59:46] Sarah (2): Exactly. Yeah, I mean, the stock market, like, it's all related to our, like, that's the way we think things are. Yeah. Because we're told, we're sold on that notion. Yeah. It's just going to keep going up. Yeah. It just keeps going 
[00:59:58] Alexa: up. Make the numbers go up. Yeah. 
[01:00:00] Will: Make more abundance. So this would suggest that, like, The only way for abundance to exist is to like then have a cycle with scarcity and for that entire thing to actually be like the wholeness of life.
I mean there's some, I mean 
[01:00:16] Sarah (2): in the economy there are business cycles, like that's, it's not, the software does go up and up, but like business cycles do 
[01:00:22] Sarah: occur at a pretty like 
[01:00:24] Sarah (2): You know, frequent frequency. Totally. Like, that just, yeah, corrects for itself. 
[01:00:30] Will: Wow. I wonder what a society would look like. Self physic frequency for a physics book.
Makes a lot 
[01:00:34] Sarah: of sense. Yeah. Look at that sun. Oh. Oh my god, that one gem of sun. 
[01:00:38] Will: Wow. Okay. Sick. The last little peek through the trees. Gold coin on the horizon. Egg yolk. It's the egg yolk. I see gold coin, you see egg yolk. Let me know which one's on Erasty. Always two. Gold coin, 
[01:00:56] Lola: egg yolk. I'm giving 
[01:00:59] Will: it Erasty.
You're a nasty girl. You're a nasty girl.
It kind of also reminds me a bit, Jacob, that poem you shared, Everything is Waiting for You. Oh, yes. Which is just the most beautiful poem, and I've been bringing it back. It's from Ireland. Wow. Great work to have it in your folk. 10 points, 10 points to Ireland. I, um, have been returning to it a lot, and everything is waiting for you.
And, it's just the idea that, like, at all times, like, this is a great matrix. A great matrix exists that is life. So even when you feel, like, incredibly alone, it's like, your greatest mistake is to act the drama, like, to think that you actually are there, alone. Because, like, the tea kettle is singing for you, like, the window latch is opening.
Like, everything is waiting for you. And I think that if you have that energy, that's like the through line for abundance and scarcity. For like moving through both. Because then when there are moments of scarcity and loss, you don't actually internalize that as like a scarcity of self. You just recognize it as part of the cycle of life.
And you still actually recognize that there is abundance and that scarcity. 
[01:02:23] Sarah: Yeah. Same 
[01:02:23] Will: thing with like, um, this other person. Our literature building at Brown that just said and then there is using everything And I was always like, what does that mean? And then there is using everything and why would the literature building of all places?
And then there is using everything yeah, and this is I just didn't understand it, you know, yeah You're being like they should have a Shakespeare quote up there cuz that means nothing, you know, like I don't get that question 
[01:02:52] Sarah (2): literature It seems not about using. Yeah, but then You think of everything. Yeah.
[01:02:56] Will: And you think of using as like actually just like finding meaning or like Yeah, or like discovering and seeing and being aware of 
[01:03:02] Sarah (2): valuing. Yeah. 
[01:03:04] Will: The opposite of owning. The 
[01:03:04] Jake: opposite of owning. Yeah. Yeah. And this is the Oh, in a wet. 
[01:03:07] Sarah (2): Totally. Yeah. Mm-hmm . 
[01:03:09] Jake: But that's how they, that's how they speak about, like, that's how they like own things, you know?
Like the kid has a toy and it's like. You can play with the toy that I'm currently using. Yeah. You can have words for it. 
[01:03:19] Sarah (2): I love that that's applied to the body. I think a lot about the body recently. But just like the idea that you're, you're so, like, you're using a body. You don't own the body. It's not your body.
But you're just using it to express in the world. And it's like, it just Well, that's fine. It's fine. It's Yeah. Yeah. And then I guess we
[01:03:39] Alexa: do, we do this. 
[01:03:39] Sarah (2): Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's true. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 
[01:03:44] Alexa: I, uh, I don't know why that's just inserted in my brain. I love the, I forget what they're called, unidentified, or un, her art pieces. Talk bear's little, like, ceiling hangings. They're phenomenons. What are they called? Do you remember what I'm talking about?
She has, like, unidentified. Unidentified. Uninhabited. What is it? They 
[01:04:07] Pierce: look like the little, like, metal, like, mobile. Yeah, 
[01:04:10] Alexa: yeah, yeah, yeah.
Objects and habitats, babe. Um,
but those are, they were like so personal. Like, you know the way that other things, other things in the house, right? 
[01:04:28] Sarah: Mm 
[01:04:29] Alexa: hmm. But they're like peaceful and still like, kind of memorable. They would make nice gifts. Yeah, I love them.
So, so bad. It's ridiculous.
Oh my god. Oh, 
[01:04:49] Sarah: oh. 
[01:04:49] Jake: Do you 
[01:04:51] Will: need help? Are you okay? Are you okay? Damn! 
[01:04:56] Jake: He got hit in the 
[01:04:56] Will: nuts. 
[01:04:59] Sarah: Oh, poor guy. 
[01:05:00] Jake: He doesn't have to 
[01:05:01] Will: run over and save him. He got hit 
[01:05:03] Jake: in the nuts 
[01:05:04] Will: he's currently using. By 
[01:05:05] Sarah: a 
[01:05:06] Will: wall. By a wall. The wall, the 
[01:05:08] Sarah (2): wall. 
[01:05:09] Will: You go over and thank him. For being so wise.
And then there is using everything.
[01:05:24] Jake: Chaos has broken loose here. Seriously, where is he gonna go? There's a wall there. Sundown and everything. Ambiguous Fish is the name of her artworks. What is Ambiguous Fish? You miss 
[01:05:34] Lola: the mom walking around with the kids. Oh, no, I saw him. Yeah. Oh, I saw him. He's a famous character. 
[01:05:40] Will: Mhm. You know, and then, a car, like, was driving out, and, like, saw him and stopped, and was in his way, and he was like, I'm good, I'm 
good.
Are you Jewish, maybe? No. Have a good day. Thanks, take care. Have 
[01:05:53] Will: a good day. 
[01:05:56] Sarah (2): No one's Jewish here, right? I can't believe this. You're Jewish? You are? Sorry. Nice. 
[01:06:00] Will: Didn't you, didn't you know what they were doing? Oh my god. You're such a mess. Hey, I like that. A little bit. 
[01:06:07] Sarah (2): I saw it happening and just kept going.
I was like, okay, this 
[01:06:10] Will: just keeps happening. I live here.
[01:06:21] Sarah (2): One of my favorite lines, I'm just gonna read it because that was beautiful. Um, maybe it'll spark some conversation. Um, If you see a thing whole, he said, it seems that it's always beautiful. Plan its lives, but close up, a world's all dirt and rocks. And day to day, life's a hard job. You get tired, you lose the pattern.
The way to see how beautiful the earth is, is to see it as the moon. The way to see how beautiful life is, from the vantage point of death. Which felt like the Flannery O'Connor, and um,
Yeah. It's such a, it's so, we just don't do that justice throughout our lives, I think. to ourselves or anything. I mean, you can maybe look back at like, you lived in a city for four years, five years, whatever. And you're like, Oh, that was so beautiful after you've left it. But you're there. Yeah. Yeah. Or a relationship or I 
[01:07:14] Lola: think we do need the contrast though, to like allow, cause like, if you think about it.
Like, when you're in the middle of something, you're so limited by, like, the feelings of stress or whatever's going on, but it's only at the end of something that you get to understand, like, what the point of things were. You're like, oh, that was so stressful, but I grew so much, or I met these people through that, or, like, the narrative doesn't exist until you've moved through the passage.
Do you know? 
[01:07:40] Sarah: Yeah, 
[01:07:42] Lola: I know. If I'm making sense. 
[01:07:43] Will: No, no, totally. No, I meant that's totally, yeah. Yeah. You see the forest from the trees, . Yeah. 
[01:07:50] Sarah (2): And there's such a human discomfort. Maybe it's the uncertainty of it where you don't know what's gonna happen next. Yeah. And like, and once the chapter slows, it's gonna be okay 
[01:07:59] Sarah: actually.
Mm-hmm . That's 
[01:08:00] Sarah (2): true. That's true. Maybe it's a, yeah. It's like a defense mechanism, survival mechanism. A little bit like they get there. Yeah. Mm-hmm . 
[01:08:06] Lola: Um, something that made me think a lot, and I don't know if there's an answer to this, was when he's being introduced to everyone at the beginning, and then, like, where he's like first seeing, like, oh, everyone all dressed up.
And then there's another scene where, or another part where he's, where they're discussing kind of the rules and they're challenging them. And it's being like a no, shh, like don't talk about it. Like, I'm so sorry, I had an hour and a half of sleep, so I'm really trying to get my words to other people. Oh, you've been great.
But, they were like pushing back and being like, no, like don't talk about it. Like we, you know, the audience would, you know. We're doing it the right way, all of that. And it just made me like, really think about the fact that like, our context to where we are, is our own objective truth in something. And like, maybe that we're happy with that, because that's like, our programming.
And that there isn't any sort of objective way to do anything. There's just like, If it feels right and if it fits the narrative that you have. Yeah. Do you know what I mean? That because there's no such thing as any of them. It's just like, yeah, what you're used to and what you've been like told. 
[01:09:21] Jake: Yeah, like what side of the wall you're looking at.
[01:09:24] Alexa: And we are very adaptable too. Like, yeah, when the conditions change, it's like almost hard to remember what it was like under different ones. Yeah, yeah. Like 
[01:09:31] Sarah (2): COVID. I think it's a good example of how, yeah. 
[01:09:36] Pierce: And I think like they're like with the like being in the mindful like in between stage there's something really relevant about like Both accepting that as like the moment and that's okay and whatnot But then also like kind of the longer term like loyalty I love I really like to express this like loyalty because I feel like my family was so like About like drive or like you like similar things or like forethought or you know Whatever whatever but like calling it loyalty feels like a lot more beautiful in a way to like express where it's like you need to Like maybe not even like belief that it's going to get better But like, just a loyalty in goodness that allows you to like, if you can hold that while you're in the suffering 
[01:10:09] Will: then.
I really like that. And even loyalty to other things. Like, oh, I'm like really determined to like, publish this thing I wrote. Or to, you know, build this app I want to do. Like, whatever the project it is. To be like, oh no, it's not that I'm like, I have to keep doing this, but rather like, I'm loyal to this.
I'm being loyal to myself. Bye. Yeah. Following that. No, go ahead. That gets brought up. 
[01:10:33] Jake: Oh, 
[01:10:40] Sarah: we got 
[01:10:40] Will: all random. These little guys. I had 15 of them last night. I had about 15 of them last night. They miss you. 
[01:10:49] Jake: They miss you. They're talking about your job, their jobs, right? And he says, I'm a physicist, not a functions analyst.
Mm-hmm . Said, , every Ian has a function, has to be a functions analyst. You're 30, aren't you? By that age, a man should know, not only is cellular function and the word again, but is organic function. What is optimum role? I'm guessing this is a typo. Uh, what is optimum role is the social organism is, I think it's supposed to say, what is optimum role in the social organism Is.
You haven't had to think about that, perhaps, as much as most people. And Shevik says, no, since I was 10 or 12, I've known what kind of work I had to do. You know, like, there was, there is that driving thing that he is remaining loyal to in being a scientist. Like what you were saying, like, Remaining loyal to like his work and his duty not only to the Organism like the social organism, but also to his like cellular Duty like what's it?
Yeah, he's like I know I have to do this In the same way that he knows he's going to be with talk for 
[01:11:52] Sarah (2): Yeah, do you guys do you think you guys know that? So 
[01:11:55] Alexa: your cellular function? Yeah 
[01:11:57] Sarah (2): Your purpose. Yeah 
[01:12:00] Alexa: Yeah, but it's not like I don't know how to Like, is it articulated? It's not the same thing every time.
Yeah, yeah, 
[01:12:07] Will: yeah, that's good. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I would agree. I know it, but it changes with me. Yeah, I 
[01:12:17] Alexa: guess. I like balancing things out in my, like, I notice if I'm in a, in somewhere where, like, people are, like, very approachable. Like my crazy starts coming out, but then if everyone around me is like free and wild, I get a little bit more, like, bothered.
So like, yeah, that's my cellular function. 
[01:12:33] Jake: That seems pretty known to 
[01:12:34] Alexa: me. Yeah, I guess so. Yeah, 
[01:12:36] Jake: you're like a, you balance the equation, maybe. I feel like I know mine too. 
[01:12:41] Alexa: What's yours? What's your cellular function? 
[01:12:44] Jake: Well, I like helping people, and I like being there for people. Like, I like guiding people.
[01:12:50] Sarah: Yeah. Like, I 
[01:12:53] Jake: like when people reach out to me if they're, like, struggling through something. And I like to, like, help, help them see the way, potentially, that they can get themselves out or through or just stay in it and process it. Yeah. 
[01:13:08] Sarah (2): Reminds me of that game. What's it called? You, like, have to name what, like, what role you would have in a medieval town.
Can we play this game? Maybe there's other people. Anyway. It's fun. It's like, are you the town prior? Are you the jester? Are you the whatever? Oh, 
[01:13:21] Will: did we do that together? I 
[01:13:22] Sarah (2): think we did. I remember we were talking about this. Jake was the 
[01:13:24] Will: jester. Did we do this? We're the fool. 
[01:13:27] Sarah (2): No, but now I think you're like the, like the guidance, the Sherpa, the like, you know.
Wait, 
[01:13:33] Will: did we play this before? I thought we did, but I mean, it was a different group. I could have jumped it. I could very well have jumped it. Do you have another group? 
[01:13:41] Jake (2): Is 
[01:13:42] Will: it 
[01:13:43] Jake (2): the 
[01:13:44] Pierce: chickens? 
[01:13:44] Jake (2): Which 
[01:13:45] Sarah: came 
[01:13:46] Jake (2): first? Which 
[01:13:48] Sarah: wall 
[01:13:48] Jake (2): are 
[01:13:49] Sarah: you on? 
[01:13:50] Jake (2): Yeah, which side of the 
[01:13:51] Will: wall? 
[01:13:51] Sarah: Yeah, exactly. Sorry, the show you're on. 
[01:13:55] Jake (2): Yeah, to the aggressive.
We're in a fucking show. 
[01:13:58] Will: And it's 
[01:13:58] Jake: the world. Wait, you have to find the game. 
[01:14:03] Sarah (2): The game. Okay, yeah. 
[01:14:04] Jake: Yeah. That sounds like a lot of fun. 
[01:14:08] Lola: Guys, I'm really sorry, but I'm gonna have to go because I have a flight. It's really late. 
[01:14:12] Jake: Flight 
[01:14:13] Lola: three in the morning, and I have to pack and wash my 
[01:14:15] Jake: clothes. Alexis got a bus down to She has to go have fun.
[01:14:22] Alexa: Again. 
[01:14:22] Jake: Can you believe it? I can't stop having fun. It's killing me. 
[01:14:25] Will: Oh my god, didn't you have the beautiful lily pants on? I love the toes. Me too! I'm 
obsessed with it. It's so good. 
[01:14:35] Will: It's so sexy. Oh my god, yeah. Oh yeah. She's going to see Earth Eater. Bad, bad girl. You've seen Earth Eater? 
[01:14:43] Alexa: Yeah. Oh, so fun. I actually have half a mind to try to get out of it, but I haven't had it.
I've seen Earth Eater. Okay. 
[01:14:49] Will: I saw her in the springtime. Yeah, we went, yeah. Really good. Really, really fun. Wait, let's take a picture. Oh. I don't know if there's one left.
It's a Coldplay era, now that it's autumn. I love it. 
[01:15:05] Sarah (2): What you listen to in the shower cannot be predicted. You cannot know 
[01:15:09] Will: what I'm going to be listening to in the shower. It's like a hardcore techno, then 
[01:15:12] Sarah (2): come Coldplay. 
[01:15:13] Will: Yeah, and then like bad bitch shit. 
[01:15:16] Jake: Here, use this. See if it clicks when you press down on it.
There might not be one in the way. Oh, okay. There it is! 
[01:15:27] Lola: What can I take with me? You 
[01:15:29] Pierce: can take some of these turtle chips. 
[01:15:32] Lola: But do you guys want to keep eating them? 
[01:15:34] Will: You can take a part of the whole. Yeah. Oh my god. Take anything 
[01:15:41] Lola: to lighten the load. 
[01:15:43] Will: I think we can get this. Yeah. You sure? Yeah. 
Shrinks, babe. Oh god, oh god, oh god.
Oh man, oh man. Oh no. He's 
[01:15:55] Sarah (2): a little stiff in there. 
[01:15:58] Will: With the um, the inscription on Odo's tombstone. It's a beautiful tombstone. The whole is to be part. True voyage is 
[01:16:09] Sarah (2): return. I love that. That's the book. 
[01:16:12] Will: That's the 
[01:16:13] Sarah (2): book right there. I'm 
[01:16:14] Jake (2): sorry. 
[01:16:19] Sarah: Sorry. Sorry, sorry. Sorry you're going there. Love you. Love you too.
Congratulations! I didn't know you were going to say it. I'm so happy. You're awesome.
[01:16:40] Sarah (2): Bye, girl. I love you. I'll probably see you at home, though. Goodnight. I love you so much. 
[01:16:45] Sarah: Say bye, 
[01:16:47] Yessy: John. 
[01:16:48] Jake: Bye. Johnny. 
[01:16:50] Yessy: Where am I going? Where 
[01:16:52] Pierce: are you going? 
[01:16:53] Yessy: The train or 
[01:16:54] Pierce: What train? 
[01:16:54] Sarah (2): The G 
[01:16:55] Pierce: probably. I'm getting an Uber to around our house if you want to hop in that. 
[01:17:01] Will: Oh yeah, they live very close. They live 10 minutes from us.
[01:17:04] Pierce: It'd be like two stops on the train. Before 
[01:17:07] Jake (2): we break, does anything feel left unsaid? Does 
[01:17:10] Will: anybody have anything that they want to Just one question. So what is the answer? 
[01:17:15] Sarah (2): Yeah. Just that one question. 
[01:17:18] Will: It didn't work. The pure propaganda didn't work either. You live in a spaceship and you're a human. Yeah. I don't think there's any way And you create a constant revolution in 
[01:17:27] Jake: the spaceship?
Oh, hell yeah. My answer, my answer, my takeaway from this is that like, what you, what your cellular function, like, I think it's kind of in that, the cellular and the organic function. Like, both are important, and you can't, You can't just hold on to one completely. And the process is important. Like, don't like maybe check the like desire towards abundance and all things where it's like, Oh, I love just like laying in bed all day.
But like that turns into depression 
[01:18:03] Sarah: if it's 
[01:18:03] Jake: unchecked. Like if I have everything I need within the reach of my bed, then I'm going to, it's going to kill me. You know, like I need to suffer and I need to. I need work, be, be without. And that's, yeah. I think I have 
[01:18:18] Lola: a bit of a, um, cynical answer. I don't think we, there is anything that we can do while we're this advanced along in our journey as humans.
Like I actually think we need to go back to like indigenous tribes and 
[01:18:38] Will: start over. Just 
[01:18:39] Lola: be minimalistic, but have like, yeah. The simple drives that we normally have, like community love, like, you know, like respect for animals when we killed them, like respect for our elders. Like by living in an unabundant world, you have abundance of all the things that matter, you know?
[01:18:58] Sarah: Yeah, 
totally. 
[01:19:09] Sarah: That's hilarious. Welcome. Do you want a chip? Yeah, we 
[01:19:14] Sarah (2): got chips. You 
[01:19:15] Sarah: got chips? Oh, whack it. A 
[01:19:17] Jake (2): whole whack 
[01:19:18] Sarah: it 
[01:19:19] Jake (2): right there. It's the prototype. Play with this. Bye! Bye! See what your sexuality is. Discover 
[01:19:27] Jake: yourself. 
[01:19:28] Sarah (2): Bye, I love you! 
[01:19:29] Jake (2): Discover 
[01:19:29] Sarah: yourself. 
[01:19:30] Jake (2): Discover yourself with 
[01:19:31] Jake: the 
[01:19:32] Sarah (2): whack it. Discover yourself.
Yeah, that's good. Okay. Have 
[01:19:36] Jake (2): to be very careful. And be very careful with it. Yeah.
[01:19:44] Sarah (2): I also feel like no society, like it's like you can't make an ideal society. Like there are just certain conflicts that are never gonna be Yeah, and the ideal 
[01:19:52] Will: is relative. 
[01:19:53] Sarah (2): Yeah, exactly. No, it's like It's like, what's ideal 
[01:19:55] Will: then? Because if you're an anarchist, then that's a very different ideal than productivity.
[01:20:01] Jake: Like, Shevik is like, we're free. And the people under us are like, we're free. We're free. We are. Yeah. I know. Yeah, it's the first time. I didn't know. Science. Yeah. It's the perspective. It's so true.
An the prison or is the world outside of Anari? The prison, which is the opening kind of like symbol that she goes with the wall. Yeah. Mm-hmm . So like it depends on what side of the wall you're on. Either it's planet is a prison or. Yeah, exactly, where it's contained. 
[01:20:36] Sarah (2): I want to imagine, I mean, I don't, I don't know if this is other sequels of the books, but like, it feels like there's two worlds constructed and they're such like, in opposites and to each other and whatever.
It's, they're fundamentally like, they're different and the foil, like they're opposite, they're composing two opposites. What would a third look like? What would a fourth look like, like, how can you like expand this into like another, like the, the Z dimension and be totally orthogonal to both of these societies?
I was trying to think 
[01:21:03] Jake: of like some other, some other like duality. 
Yeah. 
[01:21:10] Jake: Because it's like, that's why I think the Tao is so important in here. It's like clear to me that she's like a Taoist, or like Taoism is important to her. I know that she's translated the Tao Te Ching, so there's that. But, with anything it's going to be the same basic principles of dualism that apply.
You know, which I think is the wall. And in this case, it's like only ownership or not ownership. But if we were to be like, oh, these are the, like, people that have, that can see color, and these are the people that can't see color. Like, they're just placeholders for, like, duality, I think, ultimately. You know, and like, that cycle is always going to kind of occur.
[01:21:57] Sarah (2): So do you think there could be a third? 
[01:22:00] Jake: I mean, there'd be a third. The third thing is, we'll have a diametric opposite, I feel like, you know, it's like, you can't just say like, hot, like, what's the third object that you would introduce into a system of like, hot and cold? Cold, yeah, no, no, yeah. 
[01:22:14] Sarah (2): I mean, yeah, and also like, going back to computers.
[01:22:19] Jake: You could be like, hot and cold, but like, yeah. What if we had a third vector of, like, um, fast? And then it's like, okay, well, fast has its own opposite of slow. Yeah, 
[01:22:31] Sarah (2): it's like, 
[01:22:31] Jake: it's not on that axis anymore. 
[01:22:33] Sarah (2): Yeah, or humidity, or, yeah. 
[01:22:35] Jake: I think that's, I think that's kind of the substance of which is working.
It's like, mitigating this duality of like, this to me feels like a big yin yang symbol, the book. Yes. Like, there were some moments in the book where I was, like, drawing a yin yang symbol while I was reading. I was like, okay, this is it. Yeah. It's very that. Like, this is it. Mm hmm. Depends on which side you think is, like, the light one or the dark one.
little lightness and the darkness, and there's, like, the little darkness and the lightness. Mm hmm. 
[01:23:04] Sarah: Could I grab this cover? Yeah, 
[01:23:06] Will: please. Um, yeah, and where like all the interesting stuff happens is on the boundary of the yin yang. Like, where they meet each other. Yeah, which is like On the texture of it. As the boundary.
You know what I mean? Yeah, and curvature, 
[01:23:19] Sarah (2): and it's not always One's not always dominating, yeah. 
[01:23:21] Will: Totally, yeah. And it touches both. Like, Chevak does touch both. You know, he's a scientist who wants to be like Pushing forward to science and so he has to leave Some of his his home behind in order to do that.
[01:23:33] Jake: I do think that what she was offering though. It's like it's not just It's not as balanced as a yin yang because Shevik at the end was like, I don't know, I still kind of felt like the moon people, if it truly were balanced, then like, they could've, they could've like, ended up with some equality between the two peoples.
But in the end, Shevik was like, We can't fuck with y'all. Y'all have to like, Get to a certain point before you can even, like, approach us. Because, like, y'all will destroy us. You 
[01:24:12] Sarah: know, and 
[01:24:12] Jake: I would think that, like, real equality, like, if it truly were, like, just a yin yang symbol, then it would be, like, 
[01:24:20] Sarah (2): Yeah.
[01:24:21] Jake: Both would be capable of taking each other down. Yeah, 
[01:24:24] Will: yeah. Both are grounded enough. Yeah, that's such a good point. Yeah, yeah. 
[01:24:27] Sarah (2): How it, there, one, it feels like one has, like, this gravity that, like, or an infectious gravity. That if it contaminate, like it'll all come from the down. The other one doesn't have that.
Cause I 
[01:24:38] Will: know, I don't even know how to pronounce that. I've never said that. We were telling it earth and moon. Okay. Moon. So had all of those really old spaceships from like whatever, hundreds of years before that they never were able to upgrade because they didn't have the resources. Where it's like, okay, that's an objective weakness compared to the brass tree, who, because they are proprietarian, because they have an abundance of resources, through that and like hierarchy, are then able to like advance well beyond them.
So there is like an objective weakness. 
[01:25:14] Jake: Yeah. It's why he couldn't share his science with them. It's like, if I just shared this with y'all, You wouldn't get it? Yeah, y'all would kill us. Like, y'all would like, destroy us, you know? Oh yeah, if you gave it to them. Yeah. Like, y'all would use this for purposes that I can't, you know?
[01:25:31] Maya: I'm gonna be honest, I didn't get to the very end of the book. Mhm. But, I think like, also, that was also something I relied on. Like, Honoris, ultimately, was more like, Like, it's interesting, like, no matter, like, even, uh, fox and the mouse, right? The fox hunts the mouse. The fox would destroy the mouse. But, like, they're, they can both meet, like, as conceptual ideas, like, in our heads, I guess.
Like, it's possible to meet in the world of ideas. And Anaris, ultimately, is more of, like, an idea space. Like, their ideal society, the reasons that they don't develop, like, a military industrial complex at heart. Um, whereas, whereas is ultimately, like, more grounded in the physical reality. Um, yeah, one has the upper hand in the world of ideas.
The other has the upper hand in the world of practicality. Um, perhaps that is, that is the, that is the yin yang. 
[01:26:39] Jake: The balance that's right there. Because if they were to like topple the NRSD people, then they would eventually be like stuck without ideas. 
[01:26:49] Maya: Yeah. Or they'd have to integrate that part. They'd have to develop it within themselves.
In a certain way, it's like a fractured mind. 
[01:26:58] Will: Yeah, and the, like, idealism of the anarchists was great enough that it was threatening the entire system on the, like, Earth planet. You know, like, that was the reason that they were so scared of the revolution and, like, sent them, and the Odonians left the planet.
Because it's true, like physical power is one thing, but then idea power is completely different and you can't kill, I think she just said this on one of the pages, like an idea can't be destroyed, it can only be ignored 
[01:27:27] Jake: or something. Yeah. was using that to explain how, why it was in the food rescues. Um, lemme see if I have anything.
I got some snacks.
[01:27:54] Will: I got a few dollars for 
[01:27:57] Sarah: you. 
[01:28:00] Will: Sorry. Thank you.
The, what were you saying about Shebek? 
[01:28:14] Jake: Using that? Yeah. He was using that to explain why it was better for the Urasti to let him go. Because if they killed him and martyrized him, the idea would only become stronger. But, like, the best thing to do with a martyr is to, like, let it go. Ignore. Let it become ignored.
[01:28:31] Sarah (2): This is a good lesson for, uh, Trump. Maybe we gotta 
[01:28:35] Jake: Oh, true. 
[01:28:36] Sarah (2): I mean, he said we're trying to mark him. I mean, like, put him in jail, whatever. It's like, it's only adding fire or, like, flame. Assassinating him. Yeah, assassinating him, yeah. 
[01:28:44] Jake: Totally. 
[01:28:45] Sarah: True. 
[01:28:46] Jake: Yeah. Part of me, like, I don't know, part of me feels like conspiracy theory about that shit.
Oh yeah. No, totally, yeah. I don't know how deeply I could go into that because I just, we never really know all the details of anything, but 
[01:29:02] Sarah (2): It would make sense. It's exactly that thing. Yeah. Like, 
[01:29:04] Jake: okay, well this is exactly the kind of Hail Mary that we might need to bring somebody back into the fold. Yeah.
Um, 
[01:29:14] Maya: Okay, Harrow and Clyde. So that's what I'm doing. They're like, the only way I think the Democrats will win the election is if someone assassinates Joe Biden. They're like, if someone assassinates, yeah, I'm like, if someone assassinates Joe Biden, uh, then we'd be re electing an incumbent president. And there'd be like, uh, oh, look at the lengths that these crazy people went to.
Like, no one can support that, right? Yeah. Yeah. Like, uh, uh, assassinating a sitting president. Which, knock on wood, I hope does not happen. 
[01:29:47] Jake: Yeah, it's not on my bingo card. That 
[01:29:48] Maya: I, yeah, it wasn't on my bingo card either. But it Which 
[01:29:58] Jake (2): is a powerful world. What's a 
[01:30:04] Alexa: Oh, um
[01:30:11] Will: Chant. Yeah, when a friend buys a ticket, oh god. 
[01:30:14] Sarah (2): Oh god, no, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Oh, 
[01:30:17] Will: okay. 
[01:30:18] Sarah (2): It's like when you want to buy the ticket, so you power. You can, and you can control the, the govers, not go. 
[01:30:23] Will: Well, I'm really happy we read this. Yeah. I think it was really fascinating. Considering I think a lot of us are very like, fuck capitalism.
Fuck consumerism. Oh, it's such an important book. For that be like idealistic and like anarchist and then like you see like what happens? You're like, okay, there is, it was a little brash one way. There was no Yeah, because I do want to be able to also like take a flight and I do want to be able to like not work in the field and work in ideas and abstraction, make art and, and then I love my family, my friends.
Yeah. Yeah. 
[01:31:02] Sarah (2): Yeah. That's very 
[01:31:03] Will: proprietary. Yeah. No, it's funny because, sorry, sister . It's funny 'cause our idea of like not being prop prop is still very proprietary. Yeah. You know, it's like, well, I still assumed that I would have a bedroom. That's mine. Yeah. 
[01:31:19] Maya: Oh, that's a great assumption. Yeah. I assumed that 
[01:31:22] Will: when I said that I wanted to be anti-capitalist or even the knowledge that you're 
[01:31:26] Jake: not 
[01:31:27] Will: banging your 
[01:31:27] Jake: sibling.
[01:31:28] Will: Yeah. Oh yeah. That's cool. I love that idea. 
[01:31:32] Jake: Like, what would their porn be like? You know, probably wouldn't be stepsister porn. No. 
[01:31:37] Alexa: But maybe it would, I don't know. Maybe it would be like ownership porn. I 
[01:31:41] Jake: don't think they 
[01:31:42] Jake (2): have the tattoos. 
Oh, 
[01:31:45] Sarah (2): totally. This is my wife. 
[01:31:47] Will: This is my wife. Yeah, they say the word mom.
This is my wife and we live in our home.
It's literally just like little house on the prairie. Do you like my sweater?
Now I'm inspired to read some of her other stuff too. 
[01:32:10] Sarah (2): And one thing that I was surprised about, I like, I remember reading like a while ago, but it was that like the kids grow up and they have to like unlearn the my. 
[01:32:20] Sarah: In their, in their dialogue. 
[01:32:21] Sarah (2): And I just would have thought like that, that surprised me that she seems to be suggesting that that's, it's human instinct, this ownership.
And I actually, like, I would have thought it would have been the opposite. We grow into my, we grow into this like feeling of wanting, you know? Um, 
[01:32:36] Will: Oh, I guess the human nature is a bit of, there is a tendency towards dominion in our nature. I'd say, well, like spend some time, take something from a kid. Yeah.
[01:32:43] Jake: Yeah. They're tyrants. They're little tyrants. They're tyrants. Yeah. You take something away. They. I think it was like sitting in a sunspot, and another kid wanted to sit in the 
[01:32:54] Sarah: sunspot. 
[01:32:55] Jake: You don't own the sunspot, you own the 
[01:33:01] Alexa: sheriff. I thought that 
[01:33:04] Jake: was really cute. Like having a mother and a father, like you, the cellular thing, like you came from.
Yes, totally. 
[01:33:12] Sarah (2): Totally. Yeah. 
[01:33:13] Jake: Like you belong to that thing in a, in a sense, right? 
[01:33:16] Sarah (2): Yeah. 
[01:33:17] Jake: Like you learn that that's your place that you go to and 
[01:33:20] Sarah (2): you learn that this is, it's the 
[01:33:21] Jake: food that you eat and it's the shelter that you have and like the relationship, the fundamental relationship is. Yeah. I feel like it is there.
[01:33:30] Maya: Actually, I, I would even say that I don't, I don't think it goes to that because, like, you can, and unfortunately, there have been, well, I mean, they were like, these experiments were done, like, in one hour. I hope they didn't, did not have lasting effects on the, on the patients. But if you, like, leave a child, Like, how does someone develop, let's say, avoidant attachment?
Um, if the caregiver walks away, like at first the baby will cry and cry and try to get attention from what you're supposed to be like, your parent or your guardian. Eventually it stops crying and like, It kind of turns in on itself to regulate its own needs. Like, I think a minus is like, even more integral to that.
It's a, it's a, like a scream from within of, wait, what's going on within me? This is my, like, I exist. outside of what's going on from other people. And meanwhile, like anxious attachment is if the caregiver continues to return to the child, then sometimes it regulates its own needs. Sometimes it's like, it's always in a state of yearning for someone to come in Right.
But, like, the, the secureness would be, oh, yes, I have my needs, they're not being met, they will be met, I am fine. The avoidance is, I have my needs, they're not being met, other people kind of suck and I can't rely on them. The anxiety is, I have my needs, they're not being met, like, I will do whatever to have All around this axis of, I exist, my needs exist, my, like, my, am, yeah, 
[01:35:24] Will: yeah, yes.
The self exists naturally. The self exists 
[01:35:27] Maya: naturally. Totally, yeah. Yeah. Self. Self. Self. 
[01:35:31] Will: He starts spelling self, C E L L F. Don't be selfish. Selfish. Who's sewing? Is she sewing fish though? Yeah. 
[01:35:45] Sarah: I 
[01:35:45] Alexa: got into a whole conspiracy theory about this being a cell phone. Where it's like, like jail cell, like you're like locked into it.
[01:35:52] Will: Oh my god. Oh my god, a cell phone. You could have an entire generation of cell phones. Woah, what are these people named? Yeah. Yeah, we can have like a little, like, you carry out phone. Yeah, yeah. 
[01:36:05] Sarah (2): And traps us, and yeah. 
[01:36:07] Maya: That's why it's called an iPhone. An iPhone. It's not the U Phone, honey. It's not the U 
[01:36:14] Jake (2): Phone.
It strokes your ego. Andton. 
[01:36:21] Jake: Andton. 
[01:36:26] Will: That's our new end scene. Ton ton. Ton ton. 
[01:36:31] Sarah (2): What are we reading next? That's a good question. 
[01:36:35] Jake: There's some stuff in the library that I'd like to revisit, but also happy if anybody has it. 
[01:36:44] Sarah (2): Yeah. I 
[01:36:49] Jake: would like to eventually get up into Dante's Inferno. 
[01:36:55] Alexa: But 
[01:36:58] Jake: we gotta get through the Aeneid to get to Dante.
The Aeneid is really sick. I feel like we could get, I feel like we could do the Aeneid Virgil and Virgil is like the guide in Dante's Inferno. So like, Oh, he's in it. Yeah. There's a lot. The whole book is basically like classical references, but it would be a great help if we knew a little bit about Rome and Virgil and his poetry to gain access to Inferno.
[01:37:33] Sarah (2): Yeah. Don't do that. 
[01:37:34] Jake: And I feel like we have some Greek under our belts now that, like, it wouldn't be completely lost on us. But the Anita is quite long. Yeah. That's the only thing. 
[01:37:43] Sarah (2): Is there a natural, like, section to read at all? I'm not really sure. Yeah. 
[01:37:48] Will: I feel like if we looked online, they would definitely have, like, Ananus?
Yeah. Ananus. It's like reading somebody's tea leaves. 
[01:37:56] Jake (2): I could spend a whole year 
[01:37:59] Sarah: on 
these. In the end. In the end, yeah.
